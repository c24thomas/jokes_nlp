The other day I ascended,"day 74 no fap

As I exited my vehicle to walk into work I caught scent of a female in heat 73.35 meters upwind. Because of the fog I couldn‚Äôt see her yet but judging by the scent she was mid twenties, and healthy. My ultra attunated hearing was able to pick up her gait, which put her at about 5‚Äô6‚Äù. My mind, free of the constraints of porn and indecent imagery, was able to calculate her weight based on the ripple in the testosterone continuum produced by her footsteps as she walked away from me.

Being that I was 10 minutes early for work, I made chase and followed her through the fog still without visual contact. I was like a pilot navigating the white abyss by instrument alone. I was trailing her about 130m behind when I sensed her phone vibrate in her purse through the pavement. Holding my ear to the ground I was able to faintly pick up on the conversation she was having with beta BF. Based on the annoyed tone in her voice I knew now was the time to strike.

I readied my legs and concentrated all of my Testo-chakras into my Vastus Medialus muscles as I assumed a sprinters starting stance. I exploded forward in a cataclysm of sex hormone fueled rage. Exactly 2.54 nanoseconds later I began to phase through time and space as I meshed with the testosterone continuum. As I phased through the helpless female target I nutted directly into both of her Fallopian tubes, destroying her previously unbroken hymen and causing her to orgasm INSTANTLY. As I began to slow down 33.6 light years later, I realized that while she would have wanted to thank me for giving her the gift of my superior seed that she was already dead and gone having raised my CHAD progeny to repopulate the earth.

"A salutary lesson. Posted to r/jokes, probably more Dad-like","Certain related tribes in sub-Saharan Africa often raided each other's villages when most folk were herding animals. Sometimes they would take vegetables and water, but more often taking little things, to gently mock each other.  It was all in good fun.  After a successful raid, the ""winning"" tribe would celebrate by dancing under the stars, or in one of their large, grass-covered spirit houses.

One day, the Imaqi took their Satari shaman's sceptre.  The following day, the Satari not only stole the sceptre back, but also the Imaqi chief's regalia.

It went back and forth, until, on a rare and daring escapade, three Imaqi warriors stole the Santari chief's throne.  They put it on display, above their chief's throne in the spirit house.

The Imaqi thought that this was hilarious, and as it was beginning to rain, made merry and danced in the spirit house.  Suddenly, the heavy throne on display fell down and killed a number of the dancing revelers.

The moral should be obvious:  those who live in grass houses shouldn't stow thrones.",dadjokes

GARDEN SNAKES CAN BE DANGEROUS,"
Snakes also known as Garter Snakes (Thamnophissirtalis) can be dangerous Yes, grass snakes, not rattlesnakes. Here's why.
A couple in Sweetwater, Texas, had a lot of potted plants. During a recent cold spell, the wife was bringing a lot of them indoors to protect them from a possible freeze.
It turned out that a little green garden grass snake was hidden in one of the plants. When it had warmed up, it slithered out and the wife saw it go under the sofa.
She let out a very loud scream.
The husband (who was taking a shower) ran out into the living room naked to see what the problem was. She told him there was a snake under the sofa.
He got down on the floor on his hands and knees to look for it. About that time the family dog came and cold-nosed him on the behind. He thought the snake had bitten him, so he screamed and fell over on the floor.
His wife thought he had had a heart attack, so she covered him up, told him to lie still and called an ambulance.
The attendants rushed in, would not listen to his protests, loaded him on the stretcher, and started carrying him out.
About that time, the snake came out from under the sofa and the Emergency Medical Technician saw it and dropped his end of the stretcher. That's when the man broke his leg and why he is still in the hospital.
The wife still had the problem of the snake in the house, so she called on a neighbor who volunteered to capture the snake. He armed himself with a rolled-up newspaper and began poking under the couch.. Soon he decided it was gone and told the woman, who sat down on the sofa in relief.
But while relaxing, her hand dangled in between the cushions, where she felt the snake wriggling around. She screamed and fainted, the snake rushed back under the sofa.
The neighbor man, seeing her lying there passed out, tried to use CPR to revive her.
The neighbor's wife, who had just returned from shopping at the grocery store, saw her husband's mouth on the woman's mouth and slammed her husband in the back of the head with a bag of canned goods, knocking him out and cutting his scalp to a point where it needed stitches.
The noise woke the woman from her dead faint and she saw her neighbor lying on the floor with his wife bending over him, so she assumed that the snake had bitten him. She went to the kitchen and got a small bottle of whiskey, and began pouring it down the man's throat.
By now, the police had arrived.
Breathe here...
They saw the unconscious man, smelled the whiskey, and assumed that a drunken fight had occurred. They were about to arrest them all, when the women tried to explain how it all happened over a little garden snake!
The police called an ambulance, which took away the neighbor and his sobbing wife.
Now, the little snake again crawled out from under the sofa and one of the policemen drew his gun and fired at it. He missed the snake and hit the leg of the end table. The table fell over, the lamp on it shattered and, as the bulb broke, it started a fire in the drapes.
The other policeman tried to beat out the flames, and fell through the window into the yard on top of the family dog who, startled, jumped out and raced into the street, where an oncoming car swerved to avoid it and smashed into the parked police car.
Meanwhile, neighbors saw the burning drapes and called in the fire department. The firemen had started raising the fire ladder when they were halfway down the street. The rising ladder tore out the overhead wires, put out the power, and disconnected the telephones in a ten-square city block area (but they did get the house fire out).
Time passed! Both men were discharged from the hospital, the house was repaired, the dog came home, the police acquired a new car and all was right with their world.
A while later they were watching TV and the weatherman announced a cold snap for that night. The wife asked her husband if he thought they should bring in their plants for the night.

"""That was so baaaad, Dad""","I remembered a good Dad joke moment.

My wife and I had picked up our daughter and two of her friends. They were in the back of our minivan. 

My wife inquired about one of the kids mothers that she was friends with since we hadn't seen them in a while. They moved because of work to another town.

I guess the job was going well and they were making a good deal of money. The kid said, ""She doing good, but she's spending a lot of money. She remodeled the kitchen and bought 4K TVs.""

They kept chatting lightly and when there was a lull in conversation, I quietly said, ""That's a lot of TVs."" Just loud enough for everyone to hear but not loud enough to really demand anyone listen. 

But then it happened. An uncomfortable pause - the fabled pregnant pause - and they started talking again. No one said anything about it but I knew it landed.

After we dropped the kids off, the first thing my daughter said, ""That was SO bad. ""

"Number wars, a dad joke story.","6 couldn't believe it. 7 had finally gone off the deep end. 7 had long offended 6. A repeat 6 offender if you will. But this was unforgivable. 9 was his best friend. How could he do this to his best friend? How could it be that 7 ate 9?

6, filled with fury, called his friends 2 and 4. They would get even. 10 was the best friend of 7 you see. 2, 4 and 6 ate 10 to get even. They then began plotting further revenge, but 7 acted first. He gathered 1, 3 and 5 together to take down 6.

Realizing that the odds were against them, 2, 4 and 6 retreated. Their only option was to turn to 12 who had twice the resources 6 had. 7 couldn't follow.

12 quickly called 3 to find out what the root of 7's attack on 9. 3 wasn't sure. He had only supported 7 because of a long standing friendship. But 3 promised to get to the root cause.

Meanwhile, 7's scheming was not yet done. 12 was powerful, but there was one who could reverse his decision to harbor 6. If he could just convince 21, nicknamed blackjack, to reverse 12's decision, it would all be over.

Three times 7 went to 21's compound. On the third try he was able to get through. After explaining that 6 had masterminded the elimination of 10, a grand meeting of the numbers was called.

Both 6 and 7 argued over the whole thing. 13 had the unlucky task of adjudicating the meeting. Each time 13 made an argument, 6 and 7 would add to it by shouting over each other.

WELL anyways, i said to him, well is the owner here? my buddy said yeah he's in the kitchen....lets go say hi, so we finished off our drinks, then we paid our fee and i set a tip underneath the milkshake glass just like in the movies. the waitress came bouncing over and so i said to her ""there's a tip under the milkshake"". she pocketed it and thanked us for our time. so i asked her ""is the boss man in today, we'd like to tell him the food tasted great"". he's in the kitchen, she told us. so we just went right in there like we owned the joint. only 2 chefs in that kitchen... it makes sense considering how small the place is.... so he's boiling some water, my buddy says to him hey man, are you hiring? he says yeah, we're hiring.... do you have experience in a kitchen? well, no i said, my buddy said.... nope, not me, but we're quick learners.... now here's the joke... we got to talking for a while the 3 of us, and then it hit me..... we DID go to school with the malook. i dont know where i was thinking we didnt go to school with him, i actually sat next to him on the bus. we got hired on right then. i said to himi ,oh and by the way, the food is very tasty considerin theres only the 2 of you in the kitchen here cooking. great fries, and the milkshake was delicious i told him...... my buddy said yeah and the bacon was extra crispy like usual, and the diet coke had the PERFECT amount of ice....and the eggs were good and actually tasted FRESH..... the owner said 'yeah thanks, we get them locally'. my buddy looked at me kinda confused look on his face, then he looked back at the owner and said 'local? i never knew there were chickens layin eggs in the middle of new yolk.........""",dadjokes

Got a good one for you all,"Q: A man walked into a bar and looked down at his phone.  On his Lock Screen was a hot dog in a bun.  The man paused, looking over the hot dog one more time and sighed, putting his phone back into his pocket.
He came here to drink his problems away.  To drink away his divorce, missing his sons high school graduation, a performance review that went poorly.  He thought about buying as much alcohol as he could and just going home to drink it all and wither away.  
‚ÄúNo one would know‚Äù, he thought to himself.  
‚ÄúI have the power to control my life and what happens to it.  I could call it right here, right now, and all I would to do is keep pressing these aluminum cans to my lips.  It‚Äôd be so effortless and I can‚Äôt help but feel, attracted to the idea‚Äù
After a quick trip to the store, he returned home with numerous cases of beer.
He opened the first can and took a sip.  Right as he was about to take another, there was a knock at the door.
‚ÄúColby..?  Are you in there?  I need to talk to you!‚Äù
Colby hesitated for a moment, wondering if he would answer the door.  After a moment of thinking, he concluded that he should at least say goodbye to someone.  He set the can down near all of the other alcohol and walked to the door.
As Colby opened the door, it took him by surprise who it was; Mark, one of his closest childhood friends.
‚ÄúHey man, I had something I wanted to talk to you about.  Care if I come in for a bit?
Colby, still taken by surprise from Mark‚Äôs presence told him to come in, forgetting about the many cases of beer sitting out in the open.
Mark walked in and sat down on the couch and right as he was about to ask him something, he noticed the cases of beer.  Mark‚Äôs train of thought came crashing down for a moment as he puzzled about why Colby would have so much alcohol.
‚ÄúHey Colby, what‚Äôs up with all of the beer?‚Äù
The second Mark asked, Colby started stuttering, scrambling for a possible explanation.
But he couldn‚Äôt think of one.  He looked up at Mark, trying to think of a way to go about saying goodbye to his friend...
But Mark, without saying a word tightly embraced him.  Whatever Mark came to ask him didn‚Äôt matter to him now, as he could see that Colby needed him right then.
They hugged tightly for a few minutes, tears stains forming on their shoulders.
‚ÄúColby, I don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôve been going through lately, nor do I believe that I might be able to truly understand how you feel either.  But you are my closest friend, and I can‚Äôt bear the thought of losing you.  You don‚Äôt have to tell me what‚Äôs been going on right now, hell you don‚Äôt have to tell me anything if you don‚Äôt want to, but I want to be here for you however I can be, okay?‚Äù
As Mark shakily uttered these words to Colby, something beyond simple words started taking place inside of Colby.  He had fixated so much on everything that was going poorly in his life that he had forgotten to take a second to think about the things that were good in his life; the people he‚Äôs close to.  In that moment, he could feel Mark‚Äôs pain at the idea of losing him, and in a strange way it helped him clear his head a little.
As a fog slowly lifted from Colby‚Äôs mind, he started to tell Mark the things that were upsetting him.  Telling him how he couldn‚Äôt see a way forward and how he felt that no one would have known that he had passed, had he drunk all of the alcohol.
Mark offered to take him on a drive to clear his head a little and to help him get his feelings out more.
As they drove, Colby smiled for the first time in what felt like months.  He looked up at the sky, and a thought bounded through his mind.
‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm going to be okay.  All these things happening to me are temporary.  I‚Äôll find someone to remarry to.  I‚Äôll apologize to my son for not being able to make it, maybe take him somewhere to celebrate one on one.  I‚Äôll start applying myself more at work.  It‚Äôs gonna be hard but-‚Äú
‚ÄúColby, are you okay?‚Äù
Colby broke from his seemingly-therapeutic trance and looked over at Mark.
‚Äú.....Honestly, no...  but I will be.‚Äù

Even Ferdinand Feghoot could be outpunned on occasion ‚Äì but he always rose to the challenge.,"There was, for instance, the time he conducted a crew of new S.A.R.H. (Society for the Aesthetic Rearrangement of History -BJ) recruits ‚Äì all from late twentieth-century Terra ‚Äì on a training study of Carter‚Äôs World, a newly established agricultural colony attempting to support itself by the export of edible nuts. Barely into their second generation, and having yet to show a profit, the colonists were technologically backward. Nevertheless, they showed a surprising ingenuity in the use of their few advantages. It was this resourcefulness that Feghoot was demonstrating to his rookies.


‚ÄúLook at the perfection with which these streets are graded‚Äù, exclaimed one student. ‚ÄúEarth-moving machinery on this scale is strictly high technology stuff. How can they do it?‚Äù


‚ÄúA new alleyway is being constructed, nearby‚Äù, said Feghoot. ‚ÄúLet us walk that way while I explain.‚Äù As they strolled, he told his students that countless centuries before, the Carter‚Äôs World system had been inhabited by a now-vanished race of giants. This very planet had served them for a nursery, and among the many artifacts they had left were thousands of childrens blocks, immense and precision-cut. You simply jack one up onto logs, bring it where you want it, put collapsible jacks underneath, snake out the logs, spread soil more or less evenly beneath, and collapse the jacks.


‚ÄúI see‚Äù, said the student. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not graded road at all; its a simple hammered-earth base.‚Äù


‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right,‚Äù Feghoot went on smoothly. ‚ÄúYou just hit the road jack and don‚Äôt come back no mo.‚Äù


His students registered dismay and anguish.


‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt that right, old-timer?,‚Äù Feghoot demanded of an ancient Carterian standing by the mouth of the newly completed alley they had just reached.


‚ÄúAhm afraid not, suh‚Äù, said the senior citizen, and the students giggled at Feghoots discomfiture. ‚ÄúOh, we used to do it that way, but it was far too much trouble. It‚Äôs the soil heah. You see, the very same soil which produced our famous cashews is so high in clay content that a child could roll out a road of it. Then, we simply use a system of lenses to bake it into hardness. Ahve just completed this alley mahself, and ahm just a retired professor of Sports History, much too old and feeble to handle hydraulic jacks.


‚ÄúSo you see,‚Äù he finished, eyes twinkling, ‚ÄúMah hammered alley is really cashews clay.‚Äù


Howls of agony rose from the students, but Feghoot never hesitated. ‚ÄúAnd he‚Äù, he said, turning to his students, ‚Äúis clearly the gradist.‚Äù",dadjokes

Fearing for the monkey‚Äôs health, he went and saw it, expecting it to be sickly and skeletal. However, the monkey seemed totally normal. Confused told his staff to weigh the monkey again. 

&amp;#x200B;

They did, but the number they reported was still astonishingly low. Sure it was a mistake, he went to weigh the monkey for himself. But when he put the monkey on the scale, it showed a number that was still far too low, and couldn‚Äôt possibly be right. 

&amp;#x200B;

After a moment he spotted the problem: behind the scale was a grab bar on the wall, and the monkey had stealthily grabbed it with its tail, and was supporting some of its weight off the scale that way.

"Obituary for the Pillsbury Dough Boy, Pop N Fresh","The Pillsbury Doughboy, remembered best as ""Pop N Serve"", and/or ""Pop N Fresh"", died yesterday of a severe yeast infection and trauma complications from repeated pokes in the belly.  He was 71.


Doughboy will be buried in this lightly greased coffin.


Dozens of celebrities will turn out to pay their respects, including Mrs. Butterworth, Hungry Jack, the California Raisins, Betty Crocker, the Hostess Twinkies, and Captain Crunch.


The grave site is expected to be piled high with flours.


Aunt Jemima will deliver the eulogy and lovingly describe Doughboy as ""a man who never knew how much he was kneaded"".


Doughboy rose quickly in show business, but his later life was filled with turnovers.. He was considered a very smart cookie, but wasted much of his dough on half-baked schemes.


Despite being a little flaky at times, he still was a crusty old man and was considered a positive roll model for millions.


Doughboy is survived by his wife, Play dough, three children: John Dough, Jane Dough and Dosey Dough, plus they had one in the oven.
He is also survived by his elderly father, Pop tart.


The funeral will be held at 3:50 for about 20 minutes.",dadjokes

Dad Jokes,"It was a brisk Saturday morning when Gerald arrived at ‚ÄúThe Caf√©,‚Äù a hip coffee shop right down the street. Wearing his large, burly black coat, he stared hesitantly at his watch. Thick glasses adorned his bright blue eyes, his gaze like starlight in a clear night sky. He was waiting, intently twiddling his thumbs. After a buzz of his phone, the message from Dad popped up: ‚ÄúParking now, be there in 5.‚Äù

‚ÄúDad,‚Äù he whispered under his breath, swiping the message away to once again reveal the image on his lock-screen: a hazy picture of an ultrasound.

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Gerald had not spoken to his father for three years. They had had a falling out, over which he did not remember. To him it was a competition of who could wait the longest without calling or sending a text. Who could wait the longest: him without a father, or his father without a son? The idea of friction in the relationship hurt like a thorn; piercing his soul more and more everyday. Until recently, out of the blue, ‚ÄúDad‚Äù popped up on his phone. The rest is history. The rest leads to that Saturday morning, at The Caf√©.

*Bang!* A car door rang out not too far from where Gerald stood. Gerald saw him. His father wore his tweed jacket like a coat of armor. His strut was now weaker than before they stopped talking; a weakness evident in his cane which supported every right step. His shortly trimmed white beard juxtaposed against his uncut, curly grey hair gave him the image of a wise wizard from a fairytale. He used to be that figure to Gerald, yet instead of a nice ancient being acting like a stone to keep him grounded, Gerald had felt as though his father was a rock pulling him deeper and deeper into a sea of monotony. Holding him back from his true potential. Maybe that was why he left? He still did not know.

‚ÄúHello, son,‚Äù came the withered voice Gerald had sook for so long, yet now that it had arrived wanted to avoid. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs been so long!‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù said Gerald, allowing a smile to grace his face. ‚ÄúToo long!‚Äù

Then they hugged, signifying a change in their relationship. Gerald had hoped something could happen to bring them closer together. He did not want to go on wondering what could have been. The regret and sadness weighed him down. Before starting a new family, Gerald wanted to be reacquainted with his own.

After finding their table and sitting down, the two began to discuss life. It was like old friends catching up after a long break. Although it took some time, Gerald began to warm up to his father once more. They began to get along.

‚ÄúSo, son,‚Äù said Gerald‚Äôs father. ‚ÄúI wanted to see you because I heard about the baby.‚Äù

‚ÄúDad, I‚Äôm so sorry! I should have told you sooner,‚Äù Gerald replied, defensively.

‚ÄúNo, no. That is not what I am talking about. Sheryll told me already. Behind your back, I presume? Thank her when you see her, please.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe told you?‚Äù Gerald began to stammer. He had no idea his wife would do something like that behind his back.

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù the father replied. ‚ÄúI think she just thought that maybe we could not go through with it ourselves. But, I am not here to talk about our long-overdue absence from each other. I have come to give you a gift. From one father to another.‚Äù He pulled out an old dusty book from his pocket.

‚ÄúDad, you did not have to.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù his father began to say softly, his throat obviously welling up. ‚ÄúI wanted to. This here is an old family heirloom, passed down from father-to-son for generations. We have all added to this story, to continue our legacy.‚Äù He handed the book to Gerald, now tears began to roll down his wrinkly face. HIs eyes red.

Gerald turned the book around, and right when he saw the title, he began to cry as well. ‚ÄúDad,‚Äù he stammered. ‚ÄúYou shouldn't have‚Ä¶‚Äù

The title of the old dusty book simply read: ‚ÄúDad Jokes.‚Äù

The father was still fighting back the tears. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry I am getting emotional. I just love you so much, and I can‚Äôt believe it is time for you to continue the beautiful legacy - nay, the art - of Dad Jokes‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what to say,‚Äù Gerald once again said, tears streaming down his face. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm shocked.‚Äù

‚ÄúHi, Shocked,‚Äù said the crying Father. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Dad.‚Äù",dadjokes

Once when trying to float an object by pointing his wand to it, any other student within his eyesight are immediately sent a letter of expulsion from the academy.

When he then wanted to put the object back down with his wand, all instructors would get grumpy the whole day.

When he chants, his voice would suddenly be heard in all the radios, television and even movie films playing in the nearby cinema.

And that one time he was practicing spells with his shiny chrome pocket watch, he accidentally saw a vision of Waldemart's evil plan and helped the academy save the world by foiling it.

It wasn't until he met a wizardry expert from alibaba that he found out what kind of magic he actually uses: Literal Casting.

"Dave, an alcoholic father, comes home one day after a morning of drinking to an intervention","
Dave stumbles past everyone as he makes his way into the kitchen where he grabs a beer. As he walks back over, he cracks open his beer, and in an attempt to take a sip, spills half the beer on his shirt. 


Therapist: ""Dave, your family asked me to come here today so we could talk to you about your drinking problem. Dave they love you very much and they only want what is best for you. I hope you'll listen to what they have to say‚Äù

Dave, not sure what to say, looks down.

Wife: ""Dave sweetheart, I love you with all my heart but your drinking has gotten out of hand. Every time I try to spend time with you, you‚Äôre hammered! You‚Äôre kids have been growing up without a dad ever since your drinking started to take over‚Äù


Dave, speechless, takes a seat on the chair they left open for him. He looks back down, ashamed..


Wife: ""I love you Dave, but if you don't change now, then I'm taking the kids and moving into my sisters house again, but this time, I won't be coming back"" 



Dave, still at a loss for words, looks up and manages to mumble out the word ""Ch.. Change..?""


Therapist: ""That's right Dave. Your family loves you very much and if you want to live the rest of your life with them, you're going to have to change. Now.""


Dave looks back down and says ""I... I need to.. Change""


Wife: *begins to smile* ""Yes honey! Please! If not for me, do it for the kids""


Kids: ""Please daddy. We love you""


Dave looks down, then back up with a determined look in his eyes, and yells out confidently ‚ÄúI need to change! Now!""

Dave throws the empty can on the floor and once again yells ‚ÄúI need to change!‚Äù



Wife: *now with tears in her eyes* ""Yes honey! You can do it! I believe in you!""


Dave stands up and slowly makes his way up the stairs.
