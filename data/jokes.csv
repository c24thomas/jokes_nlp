Corey the Drapery Salesman,"Hope you like this joke, I just made it up.

Corey owned a business where he sold drapery for windows, and he was doing very well!

His business was thriving and making money. It was probably because he was a very friendly person who promised his customers 100% satisfaction on everything he sold. People knew him to be timid and frail, but he also perseveres to bring people service with a smile.

And that's when three thieves saw an opportunity. 

They decided to rob his store and take all his money. ""He's a big softy, robbing him will be easy!"" they thought.

Later that night, the three thieves walk into his store, pretending to be shopping. Corey greeted them with the usual hello, but noticed something off about them, and that's when the three each pulled a knife on him.

""Alright Corey! Give us all your money!"" the three men said.

Yet Corey hesitated. Instead of shrinking from fear, a fire started to brew in him, and that's when he yelled ""LIKE HELL I WILL!""

And the fight of a lifetime broke out!

Corey was outnumbered three to one and the odds were against him but he went at them anyway. Fists were thrown knocking down everything in the store. Windows were shattered by people being thrown through them. Corey's precious drapery got torn off the hooks. Knives were disarmed, bones were broken, and noses were bleeding all over the place.

And then... it was over. The three men lay on the ground, broken and bruised. Corey had won the battle.

How was a drapery salesman able to beat up three thugs armed with knives at night you ask?

That's easy.

Thankfully it's not another virus we have to worry about.,"The police have found a large number of dead crows on the 101 just north of
Ventura early this morning, and there was concern that they may have died from Avian Flu
A Pathologist examined the remains of all the crows, and, to everyone's relief, confirmed
the problem was NOT Avian Flu.
The cause of death appeared to be from vehicular impacts. However, during analysis it
was noted that varying colors of paints appeared on the bird's beaks and claws.
By analyzing these paint residues it was found that 980 of the crows had been impacted by
 motorcycles, while only20 were impacted by cars.
The investigators then hired an Ornithological Behaviorist to determine if there was a
cause for the disproportionate percentages of motorbike kills versus car kills.
The Ornithological Behaviorist quickly concluded that when crows eat road kill,
they always have a look-out crow to warn of danger. They discovered that while all the
lookout crows could shout ""Cah"", not a single one could shout ""bike""",Jokes

The pigeon flies over to the picnic, landing close to one of the plates. He flapped around, hopping, and flying and cooing. The father looks over and laughs, taking a piece of bread and throwing it to the pigeon. The pigeon, carrying the bread over, eats it happily as the snake and bear look on. 

""Please,"" the snake says, ""I can do better."" The snake slithers up to the picnic, near the plate of muffins. As the snake slithered, the father let out a yelp. Immediately the father chased the snake away from the picnic, until the snake was back with the pigeon and bear. 

The bear laughed. ""You guys are amateurs,"" he said, rolling on the ground. ""Amateurs!"" said the pigeon, ""you think they were afraid of the snake, what makes you think they're not going to be afraid of you?"" The bear smiled. ""Just watch,"" he said as he walked over to the picnic.

The pigeon and snake watched as the bear approached the family. They dropped their jaws when to their absolute shock the family laughed and gave him a large plate of ribs.

"In 1850, prospectors rushing for a chance to get rich erect a small mining settlement near a river in California.","The prospectors and miners all arrive in a hurry so that they can stake their claims in the river before anyone else, and leave once the river is filled with claimed territory.

That is, all except one.

In the rush of miners, there was one that moved steadily and took his time to reach the river. When he got there, all the spaces were filled, and the rest of the miners moved on. However, this steady one remained behind, set himself up a little camp, and played his banjo while he watched the miners search for gold.

This went on for a few days, until one miner passes this time having not found a single flake of gold. Giving up, he decides it's best to cut his losses and head back to his home in the east.

The miner improvised a sign out of a branch, some driftwood and a quill he brought so he could write home. He writes on the sign, ""No Gold Here.""

With a sigh and a tip of his hat, he throws his sack over his shoulder so he can pack up.

As soon as he steps out of his claim, the man waiting by the river eagerly stands up, tosses his banjo aside and tears the sign out of the abandoned claim.

The retired miner looks at him, puzzled.

""Wotchu doin' dere, boy?"" He asks. ""Dincha see da sign? Dere ain't no gold dere.""

The man then puts the miner's sign back where it was.

""Dere is now!"" He says proudly.

As he goes to the first house to deliver their mail, he was greeted at the door with a smiling family and a bouquet of flowers.

As he goes to the next house to deliver their mail, he was greeted at the door with a nice couple and a box of chocolates.

As he goes to the third house to deliver their mail, he is greeted at the door by a gorgeous blonde wearing sexy lingerie. She beckons him inside, takes him upstairs, and has wild passionate sex with him. After they finish, she asks if he'd like a cup of coffee. He says sure.

The blonde brings him a cup of coffee that has a dollar bill stuck to the bottom. The postman says, ""Thank you for everything, that was amazing, but I have to ask. What's the dollar for?""

The blonde replies, ""Last night, I told my husband it was your last day before retiring and asked what we should get you. My husband said, 'Fuck him, give him a dollar.'""",Jokes

A famous winning racehorse,"was plagued by a nasty bird that kept building a nest in it's mane. The little bird would sit on the nest and sing which kept the horse from sleeping or servicing mares.

The trainer tried everything. He shaved the mane, but the bird wouldn't leave. He tried to poison the bird. He bought cats and kept them hungry. Nothing worked. This went on for months.

The owner hired a shady character who claimed to be able to sort out any problem with any horse. The fellow arrived at the barn and said he would guarantee the bird would leave for $100,000.

The owner eagerly agreed. The fellow walked over to the horse and took a package of yeast from his pocket and sprinkled it in the horse's mane. For the first time, the bird flew away.

The owner was astounded. As he was writing out a check, he told the fellow he had spent almost a million dollars trying to fix the problem. ""How did you know that would work,"" the owner asked.

The fellow said, ""I am surprised you never heard the poem.""

A chemistry professor posted a bonus question to an exam:," 

Is Hell exothermic (gives off heat) or endothermic (absorbs heat)?

Most of the students wrote proofs of their beliefs using Boyle's Law (gas cools when it expands and heats when it is compressed) or some variant.

One student, however, wrote the following:

First, we need to know how the mass of Hell is changing in time. So we need to know the rate at which souls are moving into Hell and the rate at which they are leaving. I think that we can safely assume that once a soul gets to Hell, it will not leave. Therefore, no souls are leaving.

As for how many souls are entering Hell, let's look at the different religions that exist in the world today. Most of these religions state that if you are not a member of their religion, you will go to Hell. Since there is more than one of these religions and since people do not belong to more than one religion, we can project that all souls go to Hell.

With birth and death rates as they are, we can expect the number of souls in Hell to increase exponentially. Now, we look at the rate of change of the volume in Hell because Boyle's Law states that in order for the temperature and pressure in Hell to stay the same, the volume of Hell has to expand proportionately as souls are added.

This gives two possibilities:

1. If Hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which souls enter Hell, then the temperature and pressure in Hell will increase until all Hell breaks loose.
2. If Hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase of souls in Hell, then the temperature and pressure will drop until Hell freezes over.

So which is it?

If we accept the postulate given to me by Teresa during my Freshman year that, ""it will be a cold day in Hell before I go out with you"", and take into account the fact that I went out with her last night, then number 2 must be true, and thus I am sure that Hell is exothermic and has already frozen over.

The corollary of this theory is that since Hell has frozen over, it follows that it is not accepting any more souls and is therefore extinct . . . leaving only Heaven, thereby proving the existence of a divine being, which explains why last night Teresa kept shouting ""Oh, my God!""

THIS STUDENT RECEIVED THE ONLY ""A"".",Jokes

The train joke,"As a little kid, Steve had always loved trains. He had the whole collection of toy trains. People would come over to his house to play with his train set. As he got older, he still loved trains a lot. However, his friends grew out of them, and they made fun of him, so he pretended to not like them anymore, so that he would be seen as cool. His parents, however, were supportive of his love for trains, so they bought him many different books about trains. For his 12th birthday, his parents took him to a train station where he'd learn all about trains.

By the time he was an adult, Steve knew everything there was to know about trains, and when he was 24 years old, he finally fulfilled his dream. He got a job at the train station... as a janitor. His job was to clean the toilets. But, he cleaned the toilets with all of his heart, and his manager saw this, so he was promoted to floor mopper. But he mopped the floors with all of his heart. His manager, again, saw this, so he was promoted to ticket scanner. He was the best ticket scanner you could ask for, and put all of his heart into it. His manager noticed that he was the hardest worker he had ever had.

The train station was running short on train drivers, and when the manager saw that Steve had a huge background with trains. When he learned that Steve knew all there was about trains, he knew that he would make a great driver.

On Steve's first day on the job, he happily skipped into the train. When he was told he could go, he let go of the breaks, sped up the train. He sped the train up too much, so it derailed once it started to turn. The train hit and killed two pedestrians. Now, this place was very harsh with their punishments, so when he was found guilty of manslaughter, he was sentenced to death by the electric chair. They asked Steve what he wanted as his last meal, and he said,

""A banana."" So, they gave him a banana, then strapped him into the chair. When they flipped the switch, sparks flew and smoke filled the chamber. When the smoke cleared, they saw that Steve was still alive and sitting in the chair as if nothing happened. The executioners saw this as a sign from God that he must live, so they released him.

The manager still had faith in Steve, so he secretly rehired him against everyone's wishes. On his first day back at the job, Steve happily walked to his train while whistling. When he was given the all clear, he accelerated the train way past the recommended speed, the train derailed and hit 10 pedestrians. He was found guilty of manslaughter and sentenced to death by the electric chair. He requested a banana as his last meal, and they gave it to him. After he finished the banana, he was strapped into the chair. When the executioner flipped the switch, sparks flew and smoke filled the chamber. When all the smoke was cleared from the room, they saw that Steve was still sitting in the chair as if nothing had happened.

Steve's manager was fired for rehiring him, however, the manager's replacement had lost all of the files. Once day, he met Steve, and found out how much he knew about trains. The train station still had a shortage on train drivers, so he hired Steve, not knowing about his background. Steve danced all night long when he found out that he was getting his old job back. On his first day back, when he was given the all clear, he accelerated to 50 mph. The train derailed at the curve, and crashed into a school bus. He was found guilty for manslaughter, and was sentenced to death by the electric chair. They asked him what he wanted as his last meal and he responded,

""I would like a banana.""

The executioner said, ""No! I am not falling for that again! I don't know how the hell you do it, but I am not going to let you escape because you ate a banana. You know what? You don't get any meal.""

After checking every last part of the chair was checked, they strapped Steve in. Right before the executioner flipped the switch, someone shouted,

""Wait!"" shouted one of the people in the room. The person checked to make sure that the chair was plugged in, and it was, so the executioner flipped the switch. Sparks flew and smoke filled the chamber, but when the smoke cleared, Steve was still alive, with not even a scratch.

They question him, ""How! How do you do it? We didn't give you a banana, we checked the chair, and we made sure it was plugged in!""

Steve smiles and answers, ""Haven't you heard? I'm a terrible conductor.""",Jokes

The Pharoah said to his wife, ""My wife, I control all that is necessary."" 

She said, ""The mines are necessary, for the ores and metals are within."" 

The Pharoah said, ""Look around you. I possess the widest of the rivers, the largest of the grain fields, and the tallest of all libraries in the land. What use is gold for jewlery and metal for swords when together we are satisfied?"" 

She replied, ""What do you say when one of our enemies attacks us, and we must defend our wheat? How will we defeat those who diplay their wealth in gold? The people will turn against us and support those with riches. What then?"" 

""Silence, woman!"" said the Pharoah, ""We will defend ourselves with the knowledge of the books. We will have eternal wealth in contentment. It is God that will protect us, for we are rich in His word."" 

""I'm leaving you,"" said the Pharoah's wife. 

""What?"" 

""I met a guy"" 

""But,"" 

""He's got lots of gold and diamonds"" 

""But I"" 

""Bye"" 

The Pharoah hung his head in shame, and continued to hang his head until stabbed in the heart by the new Pharoah, who owns the mines.  

Jesus told this story and the crowd was surprised. ""But Jesus,"" they said, ""this story is not right. The Pharoah lived with God.""

 Jesus replied, ""Do you hear and not understand? Listen to how stupid you sound. 'This story is not right.' Have I ever said life is fair? Life is fucked up to hell and back, guys. Abandon ship while you still can.""

The lost family legacy of the swordsmiths,"My grandfather revealed the story behind our family name to me a few weeks before he passed - our ancestors used to be Swordsmiths to the ancient dynasty.

He is said the reason our swords were so good were because of the 5 qualities that earned us our nickname - the SWORDs. 
S stands for the skills needed to craft the perfect blade - passed generation to generation.

W denotes the wisdom to know a larger, sharper sword is not necessarily a better sword.
O comes from our obsession to spend hours casting the blade into the perfect form
R reminds us of the responsibility we have to prevent our swords falling into the wrong hands
D stands for the discipline required to practice the art consistently across generations.

He proudly said he can see in me the wisdom, the obsession, the sense of responsibility and the discipline required for making a great swordsmith. His expression changed to one of regret when he revealed that my father was the last member of the family to have these qualities, and our legacy as swordsmiths was lost forever when he died before he could pass on the skills to me - for without the Skill I am but a humble wordsmith.",Jokes

NSFW: anecdote that sure feels like a dirty joke but has no punchline. Help me out.,"A mate told me this last night:

I was at a sex show in Amsterdam with a girlfriend a few years ago.  Got a beer, chatted with the bartender about the footy game that night.  The bartender said he was concerned about Netherland's defense.  

Sex show starts, and the guy in the couple is the bartender.  He comes out on the stage with a boner and starts banging the hell out of this chick. As he was pounding away, I turned to my date and said 'he's concerned about Netherland's defence in the game tonight' and she said 'that's nice'.  Bartender pulls out, comes all over girl, applause.

My mate goes up for another beer (asks first ""did you wash your hands""), bartender says 'How did you like the show'.  My mate said it was fine.  Bartender said it was just OK, he didn't feel like he was really on form.  My mate said nah, you were fine.

Brings beer back to his girlfriend and said 'he had performance anxiety'.  Girlfriend says 'Oh, no, he was fine'

A woman was in bed with her husband.,"Every night, the husband farts in his sleep. His farts were so loud and disgusting that, most nights, she couldn't sleep at night.

One day, she tries to tell him ""honey, please stop farting in bed. It's hard to sleep when just as I'm about to get some rest I hear this sudden *POOMPH*  from you"", but he just responded with another fart. She then tells him ""you know, if you keep on doing this, one day you'll shit your own guts out."" He brushed this off with a short laugh before getting to sleep.

The next day, the wife goes to the butchers and orders their entire stock of pig entrails and assorted offal, and freezes it back home. In the early morning, just before her husband woke up, she placed all of the entrails in the bed where his ass was pointing, and stuck some offal in his pants, and went down to watch some TV.

About an hour later, she hears some loud screaming as her husband exclaims ""OH SHIT, I'VE SHAT MY OWN GUTS OUT JUST LIKE YOU SAID!"" and she chuckled to herself as the screaming lasted for about an hour while her husband locked himself in the bathroom.

Later, the husband went down and she asked ""honey, how was your rest tonight?"", pretending not to have heard the screaming earlier. The husband replied ""I'm sorry darling, you were right about me farting so hard that I'd shit my guts out. This morning I did, and I promise that I'll never fart in bed again. I'll even wash all the sheets tonight to show how sorry I am."" Finally, she asks why he was upstairs so long. 

He responds: ""it's ok, don't worry, I was spending a bit of time trying to fix everything. 

I've now got all my guts back up where they belong again.""",Jokes

I was sitting at my desk when I remembered a phone call I'd forgotten to make. I found the number and dialed it. A man answered, saying 'Hello'  


I politely said, ' This is Chris. Could I please speak with Robyn Carter?' Suddenly a manic voice yelled out in my ear, 'Get the right f \*\*\* ing number!', and the phone was slammed down on me. I couldn't believe that anyone could be so rude. When I tracked down Robyn's correct number to call her, I found that I had accidentally transposed the last two digits.  


After hanging up with her, I decided to call the 'wrong' number again.  
When the same guy answered the phone, I yelled 'You're an \*\*\*\*\*\*\*!' and hung up. I wrote his number down with the word '\*\*\*\*\*\*\*' next to it, and put it in my desk drawer. Every couple of weeks, when I was paying bills or had a really bad day, I'd call him up and yell, you're an \*\*\*\*\*\*\* !' It always cheered me up.  


When Caller ID was introduced, I thought my therapeutic '\*\*\*\*\*\*\*' calling would have to stop. So, I called his number and said, 'Hi, this is John Smith from the telephone company. I'm calling to see if you're familiar with our Caller ID Program?' He yelled 'NO!' and slammed down the phone. I quickly called him back and said, 'That's because you're an \*\*\*\*\*\*\*!' and hung up.  


One day I was at the store, getting ready to pull into a parking spot. Some guy in a black BMW cut me off and pulled into the spot I had patiently waited for. I hit the horn and yelled that I'd been waiting for that spot, but the idiot ignored me. I noticed a 'For Sale' sign in his back window, so I wrote down his number.  


A couple of days later, right after calling the first \*\*\*\*\*\*\* (I had his number on speed dial), I thought that I'd better call the BMW \*\*\*\*\*\*\* too.  
I said, 'Is this the man with the black BMW for sale?'  
He said, 'Yes, it is.'  
I asked, 'Can you tell me where I can see it?'  
He said, 'Yes, I live at 34 Oaktree Blvd, in Fairfax . It's a yellow rambler, and the car's parked right out in front.'  
I asked, 'What's your name?'  
He said, 'My name is Don Hansen.'  
I asked, 'When's a good time to catch you, Don?'  
He said, 'I'm home every evening after five.  
I said, 'Listen, Don, can I tell you something?'  
He said, 'Yes?'  
I said, 'Don, you're an \*\*\*\*\*\*\*!'  
Then I hung up, and added his number to my speed dial, too. Now, when I had a problem, I had two \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* to call. Then I came up with an idea.......  
I called \*\*\*\*\*\*\* #1.  
He said, 'Hello.'  
I said, 'You're an \*\*\*\*\*\*\* !' (But I didn't hang up.)  
He asked, 'Are you still there?'  
I said, 'Yeah.'  
He screamed, 'Stop calling me!'  
I said, 'Make me.'  
He asked, 'Who are you?'  
I said, 'My name is Don Hansen.'  
He said, 'Yeah? Where do you live?'  
I said, '\*\*\*\*\*\*\*, I live at 34 Oaktree Blvd , in Fairfax, a yellow rambler, I have a black Beamer parked in front.'  
'He said, 'I'm coming over right now, Don. And you had better start saying your prayers.'  
I said, 'Yeah, like I'm really scared, \*\*\*\*\*\*\*!' and hung up.  


Then I called \*\*\*\*\*\*\* #2.  
He said, 'Hello?'  
I said, 'Hello, \*\*\*\*\*\*\*.'  
He yelled, 'If I ever find out who you are...'  
I said, 'You'll what?'  
He exclaimed, 'I'll kick your \*\*\*!'  
I answered, 'Well, \*\*\*\*\*\*\*, here's your chance... I'm coming over right now!'  


Then I hung up and immediately called the police, saying that I lived at 34 Oaktree Blvd, in Fairfax , and that I was on my way over there to kill my gay lover. Then I called Channel 9 News about the gang war going down in Oaktree Blvd. in Fairfax . I quickly got into my car and headed over to Fairfax . I got there just in time to watch two \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* beating the crap out of each other in front of six cop cars, an overhead News helicopter and surrounded by a news crew.

Cinderella's naughty side,"shenanigansEveryone knows the tale of Cinderella and Prince Charming, however, there was more to that 'fairy tale'.

You see, Once Upon a Time when Cinderella got sick of Prince Charming's 'not so great skill in the sack, she kicks him out and decides at the next grand ball, she is going to prowl for a new suitor.

She heads to the red district of the land and goes into the very skanky tailor shop, asking the seamstress to make her the most appealing and sultry outfit known in the lands!

The seamstress, knowing full well who this is and heard through the grapevine of her sexual appetite, sets herself to work.

Low and behold, she presents Cinderella with the shortest of skirts for a dress, the lowest of cuts to show off her ample bosom, and not much else. Cinderella herself is very pleased with this and also decides to forego the wearing of her underoos as well.

She parades around each day before the ball in front of the mirror, making the servants drool with lust, and upon the eve before the ball, 'Aunt Flow' has decided that the week of despair will begin!!

Now Cinderella is not going down with a fight and pleads for her Fairy Godmother to help her in this plight, ""Oh Fairy Godmother!"" she beckons.

""What do you want now you trashy tramp?"", she responds in disdain.

""Will you please help me get rid of this nasty monthly situation!"", Cinderella begs of her.

""Listen you skank! I'm a fairy Godmother, not a genie! Damn twatwaffle!"" scolds the Godmother, ""Tell you what, I had a visitor from the future and they showed me this amazing device called a tampon. This way, you can still flash every Tom, Dick, and Harry at the ball. Follow me while we go to the pumpkin patch again to find you a suitable pumpkin to transform into this bloody stopper for your she-cave!""

""Oh, splendid!"", Cinderella cheerfully says and she skips behind her.

The Fairy Godmother is not happy with Cinderella's shenaigans and decides to pick the largest pumpkin for punishment. POOF! She transforms the huge pumpkin into a teeny little tampon, ""Now remember, the same rules as last time, you are going to need to remove that tampon at the strike of midnight! Otherwise what you thought in the past was feeling as bloated was, that will be small in comparison!""

Cinderella in her excitement is only half-assed listening to her, ""Yeah, yeah, I know!""

Off to the ball, she goes! She is naturally, the main attraction and everyone there is trying to get in good with the nympho that they have heard about! The night carries on and she is on cloud nine, feeling all the sexual energy within the room. As she is dancing with this one male, the clock begins to strike! ""Oh no! I need to get going! We should meet again very soon I hope!""

The man, knowing full well who she is, decides to play the game, ""But how shall I find you? What is your name?""

""Cinderella silly! What is yours?""

Effects of shaving my ass hair,"Don't Shave That Hair!!!
I have recently made a mistake in my life, and I offer my story to you, that you may learn from my error. It all started, as many things do, with me having trouble shitting.

No, I was not constipated; this was not a regularity problem but a matter of technique. It seems my ass-hair had grown to such a length that tiny grogans were constantly getting tied up in the matted jungle between my asscheeks. It led to much frustration, with me KNOWING that I still had something to drop, but unable to shake the tenacious turd loose from its butthair dwelling. Eventually I would have to do two things: either reach down with some paper and try to pinch off the lingering loaf (which required careful precision to avoid smearing the creature all over my rear, especially since I had no way of seeing what I was doing) or just go for broke, start wiping, and hope that I could remove all the leftover fecal matter before the toilet paper reached its Can't-Be-Flushed threshold.

I was contemplating this problem, when I had what seemed at the time to be a bright idea. ""Hey! This is my butt and my butt-hair, right? So why don't I just eliminate all the hair, and then my grogans will flow out like beer from a keg!"" I said to myself. It is a statement that will go down in history with a lot of other regretted statements. ""How many Indians could there be?"" said by General Custer. ""Looks like a good day for a drive!"" by JFK. ""There! America On-Line now has complete Usenet access!"" by some idiot system tech. Such was my anal shaving idea.

I performed the operation that night, with a cheap disposable razor and a towel to sit on. Starting from the bottom, and shaving from the crack to the cheeks, I began the arduous process of ridding my ass of hair. Occassionally, I would have to clean the razor of accumulated hair and miscellaneous slime, which I did by wiping it on the towel. Slowly, my twin mounds and the between-ravine began to resemble the hairless cheeks of a newborn baby. Finally, I wiped the razor one last time, and surveyed my work. The towel was covered with a pile of hair. My ass was smooth as ivory. I smiled, satisfied, thinking my troubles were over.

Little did I know.

I now have a great respect for anal-hair. Like everything in this world God created, it has its mighty purpose in existence. It was only after I had removed it that I started to learn how much I had been taking it for granted. For one, it provides friction. I learned this the next day, when I walked out into the sun heading for class. After climbing two flights of stairs and starting to sweat, I started to notice something unpleasant. The sweat was accumulating in my crack, and was causing the unpleasant sensation of my two asscheeks sliding past each other with every step. I thought about going to the bathroom and wiping it off, but had to get to class. Eventually, I thought, it would dry.

Unfortunately, it did dry, but only after mingling with the microscopic shit- molecules lingering around my brown starfish. When I stood up after class, my cheeks were stuck together with a slimy sticky shit/sweat combination. As I made my way back to my dorm, it started to itch. God-DAMN, did it itch! Felt like a swarm of ants was making its way up and down my crack. Fighting to keep from jamming my hand down there and scratching away, I rushed back to the dorm.

Unfortunately again, this exertion caused me to sweat, and when I finally reached my room, my cheeks were sliding back and forth against each other like a pair of horny cane-toads. I quickly dropped my pants, and attempted to dry my ass off by sticking it in front of a fan and spreading my cheeks. As I pulled the two mounds of flesh apart, a horrible stench burst free and filled the room. Every dog within a 4 block radius started to howl. I had it worst of all, as the ripe aroma of festering shit/sweat went into the fan and blew back into my face. I fought to keep from heaving. And as I sat there, fighting vomit, my ass cheeks spread and dripping, with the concentrated aroma of my body odor mixed with the tangy smell of my own shit blowing right into my face, I had only one thought: ""It will be like this until the hair grows back. Weeks.""

Later on, trying to deal as best I could, wiping my ass at every opportunity, I discovered another wonderful use for ass-hair - ventilation. I attempted to launch a fart, only to have it get stuck between my asscheeks. Apparently, with no hair, the two pink twins can get vacuum sealed together, and the result was a frustrating fart that slid up and down between my cheeks like a lost gerbil.

As if that wasn't enough, I am now enduring further torture. As anyone who has ever shaved anything knows, when hair is first growing in, it comes in as stubble. Imagine your ass having the texture of a brillo pad. Well, that is what I am dealing with now. It is a hellish torture, and there are many times when I just look out the window and contemplate why I shouldn't just jump out and get it all over with in one fleshy splat, rather than endure this constant agony.

Friends, DON'T SHAVE YOUR ASS-HAIR!",Jokes

After weeks of seeing that, head-boy told his mommy: I want legs! And his mommy said: You know Cutie pie-head, we prayed hard to have you. If you pray hard enough, I promise you'll have legs.

That same night, head-boy prayed hard: I want legs! I want legs! I want legs!

Greatest joke ever told. Although long,"There was once a boy. He was the son of the richest man in the universe. Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, he dwarfed them all. He was a multi-trillionaire. Now, it was this boy's birthday. His father asked him,

""My son. I am the richest man in the universe. I could buy you anything you want for your birthday. A store full of lego, all the video games in the world, anything. What would you like?""

His son replied.

""Oh father. It would make me the happiest boy in the world if you could get me one pink ping pong ball.""

His father was rather confused by this request. Out of all the things he could've chosen, his son chose a ping pong ball. Nonetheless, he agreed and gave him a pink ping pong ball. His son was overjoyed and spoke to him.

""My father, you have made me the happiest boy in the world. May I go up to my room and play with my pink ping pong ball?""

""Okay son, go ahead.""

The boy then went up to his room and played with his pink ping pong ball. When his father went in the next morning to check on him, the boy was sleeping in his bed and the pink ping pong ball was nowhere to be found.

On the boy's next birthday, his father asked him again.

""My son. I am the richest man in the universe. I could buy you anything you want for your birthday. What would you like?""

His son replied.

""Oh father. It would make me the happiest boy in the world if you could get me one box full of pink ping pong balls.""

His father was again, confused by this. Still, he bought a cardboard box and filled it with ping pong balls. He gave it to his son, who said.

""My father, you have made me the happiest boy in the world. May I go up to my room and play with my pink ping pong balls?""

The father nodded, and the son went up to his room to play. The next morning when his father went to check, the boy was sleeping peacefully and there were no pink ping pong balls in sight. Just the empty cardboard box in the middle of the room.

On the boy's next birthday, his father asked him again.

""My son. I am the richest man in the universe. I could buy you anything you want for your birthday. What would you like?""

""Oh father. It would make me the happiest boy in the world if you could get me one truck full of ping pong balls.""

Now, by this point, the father was extremely confused. Why did the boy want so many pink ping pong balls and where were they going? He asked.

""My son. You are the most precious thing in the world to me and I can certainly get you this, but may I ask, why do you want a truck full of pink ping pong balls?""

His son replied.

""My father. Please humour me for a while longer. I will tell you when the time is right.""

His father agreed and ordered a truck full of pink ping pong balls. The boy said.

""My father, you have made me the happiest boy in the world. May I go into the truck and spend the night playing with the pink ping pong balls?""

The father agreed and the boy spent the night in the truck. When the father went back to check on him in the morning, all the pink ping pong balls were gone, and only the boy was left, sleeping in the back of the truck.

The day before the boy's next birthday, his father asked him again.

""My son. I am the richest man in the universe. I could buy you anything you want for your birthday. What would you like?""

""Oh father. It would make me the happiest boy in the world if you could get me one oil tanker full of ping pong balls.""

The father was very confused by this and had to ask again.

""My son can you tell me why you want these pink ping pong balls?""

His son replied.

""My father. Please humour me for a while longer. I will tell you when the time is right.""

His father once again, agreed and bought all the ping pong ball factories in the world and made the workers work overtime to produce all the pink ping pong balls needed. He also bought an oil tanker and a pump, a crane and a dump truck to get all the ping pong balls in overnight. On his birthday, his father gave him the oil tanker full of pink ping pong balls. The boy said.

""My father, you have made me the happiest boy in the world. May I go into the oil tanker and spend the night playing with the pink ping pong balls?""

Now the father had expected this and had made sure the oil tanker was completely safe for the boy's use. He agreed and the boy went into the oil tanker for the night. The next morning, when the father went to check, all he found was his son sleeping in the ship with all the pink pong balls gone without a trace.

Now, a few days before his next birthday, the boy got into a huge car accident and was on the verge of death. His father asked him.

""My son. I am the richest man in the universe. I could buy you anything you want for your birthday. What would you like?""

The boy replied with a choked voice, obviously forcing himself to speak despite the pain.

""My father... It would make me the happiest... boy in the world... if you could get me one... pink... ping pong ball...""

His father replied.

""My son. This may be the last time I ever speak to you. Will you please tell me why you wanted all the pink ping pong balls?""

""Alright father. Come closer.""

His father nodded, bringing his face up close to his son's. The son's voice was getting weak by this point, coughing in between breaths. Still, he brought up the strength for one final sentance.

""The reason I wanted all the pink ping pong balls is-""

And then he died.

Czech in the Mail,"There once was a famous lion trainer, he was marvelous, people from all around came to see him perform his tricks. But the man is getting old so he decides to retire, he also chooses to start a school to train more lion trainers like him. 2 students show up to the school, an Irish man, and a Czech man, so after weeks of training the retired lion trainer leaves the school to run some errands, and leaves the students alone with their lions. So when the trainer comes back to the school he sees the Irish man running to him ""come quick"" he shouted in terror, so they get inside and the Irish man says ""the Czech man was eaten by a lion!"" So the trainer says, ""which lion? The male or the female?"" And the Irish man says ""the male"" so the trainer gets his sword, and cuts open the lion, but there is no Czech man inside. The lesson of the story is to never trust an Irish man when he says there is a check in the mail",Jokes

"Bill Nye the Science Guy™, Harry Potter, and Bob the Builder ® walk into a bar...","Bill asks the bartender for a round of drinks for himself and his friends. 

""You know that your friends aren't real but are instead fictional characters, right?""

""Oh yeah, I guess you are right"" replies Bill. The four of them laughed about the implausible situation that they now found themselves in as they realized the absurdity of it all. 

If the situation had warranted it, the bartender would have asked any of them ""Why the long face?"". But it didn't come up, as they all seemed to be enjoying themselves. This is a great endorsement not only of the bar but also the close-knit friendship that the three of them have forged. 

They had a nice evening out. Once they were ready to leave the bar and retire for the evening each responsibility hailed a cab rather than drive home intoxicated. Not exactly relevant to the joke, but inspiring nonetheless due to the consideration of the environment that went into it , Bill and Bob opted to share a cab which helped to reduce their collective carbon footprints. The environmental concern heavily factored into the decision. I guess you could say that even while impaired they are both responsible forward thinking people who live their visions of making the world a better place and I for one feel inspired as I always do when celebrities turn out to be worthwhile role models even when ""off the clock"". 

This concludes the joke.

The woman by the lake...,"So, this morning. I went for a walk at the park. Not a run, just a nice leisurely stroll along the lake. As I was walking on the path, I saw a woman with no arms and no legs sitting on a bench and she was crying.

I was trying to be nice and felt bad for her, so figured I’d see if she wanted to talk. So I asked her what was wrong and why she was crying.  She looked at me and said clear as day, “I was born like this. With no arms and no legs...”

She then told me that she had never been hugged before. I asked her if a hug would make her feel better. She nodded. So I went in front of her and gave her a hug. Like a nice squeeze, but not too tight or for too long. 

But she kept crying. I sat down next to her and asked if the hug wasn’t good enough to cheer her up. Like now I’m the one with a problem, right? ANYWAYS. 

So then tells me that the hug WAS nice. But. She’s still sad because she has never been kissed before. 

Now, this is where I probably should have left.  But I figure what the hell and asked if she wanted me to kiss her. I mean, she wouldn’t be awful if she had arms and legs. Probably not a 7, but definitely a solid 6. 

She smirks a little and then says that she would like that. So I leaned in and kissed her. It was alright, but stopped pretty quickly. 

She thanked me and I started to get up to leave. Had to finish the walk as I was about halfway around the lake. Needed to get home so I could get to work on time. 

As I was getting up, she started crying again. Ugh. So I sit back down and ask her again what was wrong. She seemed kind of timid here, but was able to say the hug and kiss were nice and all....

Then she says, “But I’ve never been fucked before.”

So I take a deep breath. Look around to make sure no one is nearby. And I ask her if she would like me to...uhhh....

Before I get the words out, she actually gave a fairly hot seductive look. So I inch closer to her, lean down, ...

Pick her up, throw her into the lake, and yell “Now you’re fucked!”",Jokes

He hears squawking and screaming from the bird for about a minute until it just stops and all he hears is complete silence. Fearing that he may have hurt the animal, he opens up the freezer and quickly takes his parrot out. 

The parrot is frozen but starts to talk. He says “I’m so sorry for all the rude and terrible things I have said in the past that may have hurt you. I promise to be better and nicer in the future.” The boy responds “Thank you, that really means a lot.”

A hiker had been hiking for a few days.,"He was extremely tired and low on food and water. As he was walking, he came across a temple of monks. He decided to ask them for shelter. He walks in and is greeted by the monks. He asks them if he could stay a while. The monks gladly let him stay a while and they feed him. The hiker, as he's sitting there eating, notices a huge door made of copper and decides to ask what it's all about. The monks tell him that only a monk is allowed to know what is behind the door, so they cannot tell him. The hiker is super curious though, and insists on becoming a monk to know what is behind the door. The monks tell the hiker that in order to become a monk, you must find out how many blades of grass and how many grains of sand there are in the whole world. The hiker gets up, thanks them for the hospitality, and goes to start his process of becoming a monk.

35 years later, the hiker has counted all the blades of grass and all the grains of sand in the world. He finds his way back to the temple he visited before, and tells the monks that he has the correct numbers. He tells them how many blades of grass there are and how many grains of sand there are. The monks tell him that he is correct and that he is now a monk. The hiker now finally gets to ask what is behind the giant copper door. They take him over to it, and let him open it. Behind the door is another door, this time made of silver. He opens that door, only to find another door made of pure gold. He opens that door to find yet another door made of diamond. The monks tell him this is the final door, and behind it lies their secret. He opens the diamond door, and what's behind it?

After the test, the manager says, ""You will be employed at minimum wage, $5.15 an hour. Let me have your e-mail address, so that I can send you a form to complete and tell you where to report for work on your first day."" 

Taken aback, the man protests that he has neither a computer nor an e-mail address. To this the Microsoft manager replies, ""Well then, that means that you virtually don't exist and can therefore hardly expect to be employed.""

A legal representative of KFC manages to arrange a meeting with the Pope.,"After receiving the papal blessing, he whispers, ""Your eminence, we have an offer for you. KFC is prepared to donate $100 million dollars to the church if you change the Lord's Prayer from *give us this day our daily bread* to *give us this day our daily* **chicken**.

The Pope responds, ""That is impossible. The Prayer is the word of the Lord - it must not be changed."" ""Well,"" says the KFC man, ""we anticipated your reluctance. For this reason, we will increase our offer to $300 million dollars. All we require is that you change the Lord's Prayer from *give us this day our daily bread* to *give us this day our daily* **chicken**.

Again, the Pope replies, ""That, my son, is impossible. For the prayer is the word of the Lord and it must not be changed."" Finally, the KFC guy says, ""Your Holiness, we at KFC respect your adherence to your faith, but we do have one final offer. We will donate $500 million dollars - that's half a billion dollars - to the great Catholic Church if you would only change the Lord's Prayer from *give us this day our daily bread* to *give us this day our daily* **chicken**. Please consider it."" And he leaves.

The next day the Pope convenes the College of Cardinals. ""There is some good news,"" he announces, ""and some bad news."" ""The good news is that the Church has come into $500 million dollars.""

""And the bad news, your eminence?"" asks a Cardinal. ""We're losing the Wonderbread account.""",Jokes

The Jewish Salesman [Long],"A fleeing Taliban terrorist, desperate for water, was plodding through the Afghan desert when he saw something far off in the distance. Hoping to find water, he hurried toward the mirage, only to find a very frail little old Jewish man standing at a small makeshift display rack - selling ties.
            
The Taliban terrorist asked, ""Do you have water?"" The Jewish man replied, ""I have no water. Would you like to buy a tie? They are only $5."" The Taliban shouted hysterically, ""Idiot Infidel! I do not need such an over-priced western adornment - I spit on your ties. I need water!” 

""Sorry, I have none - just ties - pure silk - and only $5.""
            
""Pahh! A curse on your ties, I should wrap one around your scrawny little neck and choke the life out of you but... I must conserve my energy and find water!""
            
""Okay,"" said the little old Jewish man, “It does not matter that you do not want to buy a tie from me or that you hate me, threaten my life and call me infidel. I will show you that I am bigger than any of that. If you continue over that hill to the east for about two miles, you will find a restaurant. It has the finest food and all the ice-cold water you need... Go In Peace.""
            
Cursing him again, the desperate Taliban staggered away over the hill. Several hours later he crawled back, almost dead and gasped...

"A CNN reporter, a BBC reporter, and an Israeli commando are captured by ISIS in Syria.","The leader of the terrorists told them that they would grant them one last request before they were beheaded.

The CNN reporter said ""well I'm an American, so I'd like one last hamburger with fries."" 

The leader nodded to an underling, who then returned with a burger and fries. The reporter ate it and said ""now I can die."" 

The BBC reporter said ""I'm a reporter to the end. I want to take out my tape recorder and describe the scene here and what's about to happen. Maybe someday someone will hear it and know that I was on the job til the very end.""

The ISIS leader directed an aide to hand over the tape recorder and dictated some comments. The reporter then said ""now I can die knowing I stayed true until the end.""

The ISIS leader then turned to the Israeli commando and said ""And now, Mr. Israeli tough guy, what is your final wish?""

""Kick me in the butt,"" said the soldier. 

""What?"" asked the leader, ""will you mock us in the your last hour?"" 

""No, I'm not kidding. I want you to kick me in the butt,"" insisted the Israeli. 

So the terrorist leader shoved him into the open and kicked him in the behind. The soldier went sprawling, but rolled to his knees, pulled a 9mm pistol from under his flak jacket and shot the leader dead. In the resulting confusion he jumped to his knapsack, pulled out a carbine and sprayed the terrorists with gunfire. In a flash, all the terrorists were dead or fleeing for their lives. As the soldier was untying the reporters, they asked him ""why didn't you just shoot them in the beginning? Why did you ask them to kick you in the butt first?""

""What?"" replied the Israeli, ""and have you report that I was the aggressor?""",Jokes

Praying hands,"In Tulsa, OK, on the campus of Oral Roberts University (Oral Roberts was one of those famous money hungry televangelists) there is a giant statue of a set of praying hands. It was discovered one day that they had broken apart and separated. They had construction engineers, all kinds of equipment, experts from every field imaginable, you name it, out there trying to fix these hands. They got them to move a little bit but couldn't get them back into their original position.

An old farmer had come into the city for whatever reason and saw all the commotion. He sat in his pickup truck and watched for hours, fascinated and amused, while these guys struggled to fix these hands. After seeing them try repeatedly and fail, he walked over to the project foreman.

""Mister, I can fix those hands for you in just a second, but it'll cost you.""

The foreman rolled his eyes and with more than a little sarcasm said, ""Country boy, if you can fix these that fast, I'll pay you a million dollars!""

""Put that in writing and I'll sure do 'er!""

The foreman thought it was a joke and wrote out a quick note and signed it. The farmer looked at the paper, carefully folded it and stuck it in his pocket. He then walked up to the statue with his hands in his pockets. He made a show of looking at them from every angle, then stepped back to the front. With his right hand, he pulled a quarter out of his pocket and flipped it up in air between the hands. They immediately slapped together in their original position trapping the quarter between them.

It’s slow, so the bartender says “sure.”

After a few drinks, the guy asks the bartender if he would keep an eye on his monkey while he uses the restroom. The monkey hadn’t moved the whole time, so once again, the bartender says “sure.”

As soon as the man gets in the bathroom, the monkey jumps off the stool and runs over to the pool table and swallows the cue ball. The monkey immediately runs back to the stool. The bartender is pissed!

When the guy comes back out the bathroom, the bartender snaps telling him to pay for his drinks and leave. So, the man does. 

A few days later the same man shows up to the bar with his monkey. He walks in and apologizes to the bartender, and hands him his cue ball back all polished up and shined. He asks the bartender if he and his monkey can have a seat while he has a few drinks. Bartender reluctantly lets him because he was happy to get his ball back. 

After a few drinks the man has to go to the bathroom and once again asks the bartender to keep an eye on his monkey. The bartender says ok but there had better not be anymore monkey business. 

As soon as the guy gets in the restroom, the monkey jumps onto the bar, runs to the end, grabs a peanut, sticks it up its ass, pulls it out and eats it. Then runs back down the bar and jumps on his stool. 

The man comes out the bathroom and asks if his monkey did anything stupid. The bartender says, “No, but he did the most fucked up thing that I ever seen. He jumped up on the bar, ran over to the peanuts and grabbed one and stuck it up it’s butt, pulled it out and ate it.”

He finished the second ticket and put it on the windshield with the first. Then he started writing a third ticket!

Penis Van Lesbian,"Back in the 50's, a man walked into a Hollywood agent's office. He told the agent that he wanted to be a big star and that he wanted the agent to represent him. The agent asked the man's name, to which he proudly replied, ""Penis Van Lesbian."" Taken aback, the agent said, ""If you want to be a big star, you will have to change your name."" The man, somewhat offended, told the agent, ""The Van Lesbian name goes back centuries and I am very proud of my name! I will never change my name! Ever!"" ""Then I won't be able to represent you."" Said the agent. ""Then good day to you, sir!"" The man yelled as he stormed out of the office.

Five years later, the agent received a letter along with a check for $50,000, written out to him. He wondered if it was sent to him by mistake until he read the letter.

The letter said,

Dear Sir, Five years ago, I came into your office wanting to become an actor in Hollywood and you told me I needed to change my name. Determined to make it with my God-given birth name, I refused. You told me I would never make it in Hollywood with a name like Penis Van Lesbian. After I left your office, I thought about what you said. I decided you were right. I had to change my name. I had too much pride to return to your office, so I signed with another agent. I would never have made it without changing my name, so the enclosed check is a token of my appreciation. Thank you for your advice..

Sincerely,

Dick Van Dyke",Jokes

The tale of Daniel Morgan,"This is a tale of Daniel Morgan,
Who had a tiny sexual organ
This gave the girls a sudden shock
When they held his tiny cock,
He laboured hard to find a cure
And poulticed it with fish manure
He tied it up with bits of string
But still it was a poor wee thing
It was just one inch long when fully reared
And lying down it disappeared
‘Twas just by chance they called him Danny
With half inch less they’d called him Fanny
One day Dan read in the Daily Mail
That things called falsies were on sale
For women who had tiny breasts
They wore things tucked inside their vest
And then went out in latest fashion
To satisfy man’s beastly passion
Our Danny said “I am a fool”,
Why Can’t I make a big false tool
He worked all night upon his chopper
And ended up with a great big whooper
Twelve inches long and made of plastic
To stretch a fanny like elastic
It really was a lovely job
Upon the end a big red knob
Dan tied it up with bits of twine
It really did look rather fine
Lying there beneath his pants
It looked just like an elephant’s
Girls all flocked around with glee
To see his bulge stretch to his knee
No other fellows stood a chance
When Dan was at the local dance
When girls were dancing around Danny
His tool kept tickling round their fanny
The girls began to faint and swoon
As Danny walzed them around the room
But what a shock Danny had in store
For one night dancing round the floor
Danny stopped and loudly cursed
He felt his strings and strapping burst
Before he reached the nearest seat
His tool was dangling at his feet
His partner said with a nervous cough
“Excuse me, but your cocks dropped off”
Ee couldn’t face the scene thereafter
The wisecracks and the scornful laughter
All these girls that Dan had dated
In tears to see his cock deflated
A girl named Sylvia made Dan sick
As she gave his tool a spiteful kick
Poor Danny screamed around the dance hall
For the string was tied around one ball
And as he staggered to the door
He dragged his cock along the floor
The band by now was almost crackers
As Dan went off to bathe his knackers
So if you are like Daniel Morgan
And have a tiny sexual organ
Remember though it’s only wee
It’s always good enough to pee!!!",Jokes

He started to slowly walk towards the cat while taking out his water bottle from his school bag. Once he got close enough to the cat, he unscrewed the cap of his bottle, poured water into it, and laid the cap down on the tarmac for the cat to sip from. 

The cat looked at the cap full of water, and after hesitating for a moment, the cat began to lick the water from the cap. The boy did this a few times for the cat before noticing a tag on its neck. He bent down to look at the tag. The tag read: “Daisy”, and had an address on it. The boy knew that the address was only a 15 minute walk from where he was now. The boy pet the cat and then picked it up, and began walking to the owner’s house. 

After about 15 minutes, the boy finally arrived at the house. He let the cat down so that he could knock on the door. He heard light footsteps approaching the door before the door suddenly opened. A girl that he recognised was standing behind the door. It was a girl from his school that he had seen walking around before. Before the boy could take say anything, the cat meowed behind him and the girl’s smile turned into shock. “Daisy!” She cried in relief as she went around the boy to pick up her cat. 

The boy turned around to the sight of the girl on the floor hugging her cat. “I found him on my way back to school” said the boy. The girl said that the cat had been missing for almost a week. She was relieved. The girl said thank you and pulled the boy in for a hug. His cheeks had turned bright red and he was embarrassed to pull away from the hug, because he knew she would be able to notice. The boy went back home, heart still fluttering from the experience. 

For the rest of the school year, the boy was too shy to approach her and he graduated high school without talking to her again. He went to college at a place where none of his friends had gone. He was alone and had to try to make friends. When he entered his first class, he was surprised to see the girl sitting in the front row by herself. He had no excuses not to sit next to her. He sat down and asked her: “How is Daisy?”. She turned around, at first looking confused, but then she smiled when she recognised him. “She’s great!” She said not knowing what else to say, only knowing she was happy to see him. The boy looked at her and her smile, and it looked just as beautiful as the day he returned her cat. This was the beginning of their relationship. 

15 years later, they had been married for 6 years, and they still had Daisy. The girl had been fighting cancer for the past year. The boy would be by her side as she underwent the treatments. The doctors told him she didn’t have much time left. The boy would lie at her side as she rested and when she was awake, he would talk to her all night, reminiscing all their years together. Unfortunately their time together was cut short. She passed away when they were both 33 on February 14th. 

The girl’s last words before entering her final sleep were: “I love you, darling. Please take care of Daisy when I’m gone”. The boy wept hearing these words and would weep more the next morning. Some time passed and the boy stopped being sad. He realised that he shouldn’t be sad that she was gone, instead he should be happy she was ever here. Even though the boy had lost his wife, he could still stroke her pussy everyday.",Jokes

“In front of you”?”, he asks, shyly.

The nurse says, “Well no, but I've seen the naked human body before.”

The patient said, “Not one like mine. You would die laughing at my naked body.”

“Of course, I won't laugh.”, said the nurse to the patient. I am a professional. In over twenty years, I have never laughed at a patient.”

“Okay then”, said the patient and he proceeded to drop his trousers, revealing a huge male body with a the smallest adult male organ , the nurse had ever seen in her life.

In length and width, it was almost identical to a AAA battery.

Unable to control herself, the nurse tried to stop a giggle, but it just came out.

Glow,"I was in Dollar Tree last night and there was a lady and two kids behind me in the LONG line. One was a big kid, one was a toddler. The bigger one had a pack of glow sticks and the baby was screaming for them so the Mom opened the pack and gave him one, which stopped his tears. He walked around with it smiling, but then the bigger boy took it and the baby started screaming again. Just as the Mom was about to fuss at the older child, he bent the glow sticks and handed it back to the baby. As we walked outside at the same time, the baby noticed that the stick was now glowing and his brother said ""I had to break it so you could get the full effect from it."" I almost ran because l could hear God saying to me, ""I had to break you to show you why I created you. You had to go through it so you could fulfill your purpose."" That little baby was happy just swinging that ""unbroken"" glow stick around in the air because he didn't understand what it was created to do which was ""glow"". There are some people who will be content just ""being"" but some of us that God has chosen, we have to be ""broken"". We have to get sick. We go through divorce. We have to bury our spouse, parents, best friend, or our child because, in those moments of desperation, God is breaking us but when the breaking is done, then we will be able to see the reason for which we were created.

On the shore, there is a bear standing quietly and thinks to itself: ""If only that mosquito would fly a little lower, the salmon would jump out, catch the mosquito and then i can rush in and eat the fish."" Behind the bear in the bushes is a hunter and he thinks to himself: ""If only that mosquito would fly a little lower, the fish would jump out, bear would run at the fish and i could shoot the animal, make a nice rug."" Behind the huntsman, there is a little mouse and it thinks to itself: ""If only that mosquito would fly a little lower, the salmon would jump out of the water, the bear would run at the fish, huntsman would shoot and wouldn't notice that his sandwich falls out of his pocket."" Behind the mouse, in the tall grass, there is a cat lurking and it's thinking to itself: ""If only that mosquito would fly a little lower, the salmon would jump out of the water, bear would run at the fish, huntsman would shoot and his sandwich falls out of his pocket, mouse would start eating it and won't be paying attention to it's surroundings and i can attack it.""

Pitch meeting for Wishbone,"VISIONARY: So there’s this dog.
PBS SUITS: We’re listening.
VISIONARY: And he loves books.
[nodding, nodding]
VISIONARY: He knows all about classic books.
SUIT #1: Adorable.
SUIT #2: Like a cartoon dog?
VISIONARY: No, no. A live Jack Russell Terrier.
[…]

VISIONARY: He belongs to a boy named Joe.
SUIT #1: Nice.
SUIT #3: And Joe reads him the books?
VISIONARY: No, Joe couldn’t care less about books.
SUIT #3: Oh. Okay.
VISIONARY: Joe and his friends’ day-to-day scrapes resemble the plotlines of great novels, and Wishbone like, picks up on it.
SUIT #2: Wishbone?
VISIONARY: The dog.
SUIT #2: Oh.
SUIT #3: The name seems like more of a turkey thing…?

SUIT #1: Should we name him something literary? Something like Dogstoyev-
VISIONARY: No. His name is Wishbone. Unlike his human companion, Wishbone is a great lover of books. When Joe’s life reminds him of a masterpiece, as it so often does, our canine Virgil guides the audience on a journey into that book.
SUIT #3: So the dog can talk.
VISIONARY: Nope. Joe and his friends and Joe’s mom just think he’s a regular dog.
SUIT #2: …Joe’s dad?
VISIONARY: Ellen is a single mom. She’s a widow. This is a story about the limitless ecstasies of the imagination, but we want to respect the complex lives of our young viewers, so sometimes things are very real.
[nodding] 
VISIONARY: Wishbone can narrate, though.
SUIT #1: So when we travel into the world of novel…
VISIONARY: Live actors, costumes, the works. Mini-Masterpiece Theater. Also, Wishbone is a character.

SUIT #2: Narrating?
VISIONARY: No, he is an actual character in the book.
SUIT #1: Ah, I get it. In the book part, all the characters are played by dogs?
VISIONARY: You get nothing. Wishbone plays a character, for example Romeo in Romeo and Juliet, and the other parts are played by adult human actors.
SUIT #3: But you said he can’t talk to humans.
VISIONARY: No, see, in the world of the book, nobody thinks he’s a dog and people understand him. Just not in the real world. But then what is “real,” right?
SUIT #2: Like they just never acknowledge he’s a dog?
VISIONARY: I mean he wears a costume, so.
[….]
VISIONARY: It’s imagination, guys! Kids understand. And that’s what reading’s all about. Personally, when I read, I picture Ivanhoe as a dog like half the time. At least.

SUIT #3: Literally Wishbone is wearing a Romeo costume and standing in front of a grown woman in an Elizabethan gown who’s asking him to deny thy father and refuse thy name, but no mention of the fact he’s a dog?
VISIONARY: Correct.
[Suits shrug, like ‘I guess that checks out’]
SUIT #2: All fours or hind legs?
VISIONARY: That really depends on the themes of the book.
[furious note-taking]
SUIT #1: Uh, can you go into more detail as to how a middle-class American boy’s life constantly resembles episodes from the literary canon?
VISIONARY: Like, his female friend wants to play soccer with the boys’ team and that’s kind of like Joan of Arc wanting to fight in the Hundred Years War.
SUIT #3: Is it?
VISIONARY: Yes.

[Suits take drinks of water. Visionary does not drink, he only sees]
VISIONARY: The classics really resonate with kids’ everyday lives. Maybe you don’t want to babysit your little sister and that’s just like A Tale of Two Cities! Or, off the top of my head, just thinking of what kids these days like to do, maybe our man Joe starts a business delivering groceries, which seems really great at first — until the corporate megalomania transforms him into a prepubescent Midas lording over the suburbs. The connections are almost too easy, know what I mean?
[…]
SUIT #2: Here’s the thing, Lance. There’s a lot of great stuff here. Creativity, out-of-the-box thinking—
SUIT #1: Out of the kennel, if you will—
[the Visionary will not]
SUIT #2: And the dog-teaching-kids-to-read concept, that’s perfect for our demographic.
VISIONARY: He doesn’t teach them to read. He inculcates in them a passion for timeless narratives.
SUIT #2: Okay.
VISIONARY: Joe’s in middle school, he can freaking read. Not that he ever bothers.

SUIT #1: I think what Dave’s trying to say is—
VISIONARY: My winsome Jack Russell Terrier is no mere peddler of phonics. He is the bard, the scop, the muse. He is the flame that lights the cave.
SUIT #3: And that’s totally PBS! But see, it’s a half-hour slot. There just isn’t much time to cover a whole Joe-gets-into-mischief A-plot and then dig into the Penguin Classics…
VISIONARY: Oh you don’t do the whole book. Ha, no. A summary is fine, or maybe even just the beginning, and then you pretend like that’s a valid representation of the text. I’m thinking probably with Oliver Twist you could just end it after chapter three?
SUIT #3: Okay, but—
VISIONARY: We’re getting kids to read here, Janice. Give them just enough to tantalize their literary palates and I guarantee you they’ll devour all these titles, cover-to-cover, and certainly not just use the surface knowledge gleaned from Wishbone to posture before their future professors and Internet dates for the rest of their adult lives.
[Suits exchange glances]
VISIONARY: Trust me, they will all finish Silas Marner.
SUIT #2: How does the dog read?
VISIONARY: The same way you do, Dave. With an open heart and ready mind.

[Visionary begins to hum.]
SUIT #1: This seems like it would be a lot more feasible as an animated series—
VISIONARY: NO. He is a LIVE JACK RUSSELL TERRIER. His eyes are fathomless pools of knowledge reflecting all the pathos of great literature. The suffering and beauty of humanity bled onto the page and breathed in by generations of readers, connecting them — us — in an unspoken communion of shared loneliness that both celebrates and eases our pain. This is where we see that books do more than describe our human condition, Kevin. By shaping our minds and drawing us ever closer together, they create it.
SUIT #3: …In a dog’s eyes?
VISIONARY: A Jack Russell Terrier’s eyes, yes.",Jokes
"When Beethoven passed away, he was buried in a churchyard.","A couple days later, the town drunk was walking through the cemetery and heard some strange noise coming from the area where Beethoven was buried. Terrified, the drunk ran and got the priest to come and listen to it. The priest bent close to the grave and heard some faint, unrecognizable music coming from the grave. 

Frightened, the priest ran and got the town magistrate.  When the magistrate arrived, he bent his ear to the grave, listened for a moment, and said, ""Ah, yes, that's Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, being played backwards.""  He listened a while longer, and said, ""There's the Eighth Symphony, and it's backwards, too. Most puzzling."" So the magistrate kept listening; ""There's the Seventh... the Sixth... the Fifth...""  

Suddenly the realization of what was happening dawned on the magistrate; he stood up and announced to the crowd that had gathered in the cemetery, ""My fellow citizens, there's nothing to worry about. It's just Beethoven decomposing."".",Jokes

"Jack woke up with a huge hangover after attending his company's Christmas party. He didn't even remember how he got home from the party. As bad as he was feeling, he wondered if he did something wrong.","Jack had to force himself to open his eyes, and the first thing he saw was a couple of aspirins next to a glass of water on the side table. And, next to them, a single red rose! Jack sat up and saw his clothing in front of him, all clean and pressed. He looked around the room and saw that it was in perfect order, spotlessly clean. So was the rest of the house.

He took the aspirins, and cringed when he saw a huge black eye staring back at him in the bathroom mirror. Then he noticed a note hanging on the corner of the mirror written in red with little hearts on it and a kiss mark from his wife in lipstick: ""Honey, breakfast is on the stove. I left early to get groceries to make you your favourite dinner tonight. I love you, darling!"" He stumbled to the kitchen and sure enough, there was hot breakfast, steaming hot coffee and the morning newspaper. His son was also at the table, eating. Jack asked, ""Son, what happened last night?"" ""Well, you came home after 3 A.M, drunk and out of your mind. You fell over the coffee table and broke it, and then you puked in the hallway, and got that black eye when you ran into the door."" Confused, he asked his son, ""So, why is everything in such perfect order and so clean? I have a rose, and breakfast is on the table waiting for me??""

His son replied, ""Oh THAT! Mum dragged you to the bathroom to clean you up, and when she tried to take your pants off, you screamed, 'Leave me alone bitch, I'm married!'""",Jokes

Lets face it English is a stupid language,"There is no egg in the eggplant

No ham in the hamburger

And neither pine nor apple in the pineapple.

English muffins were not invented in England

French fries were not invented in France.

We sometimes take English for granted

But if we examine its paradoxes we find that:

Quicksand takes you down slowly

Boxing rings are square

And a guinea pig is neither from Guinea nor is it a pig.

If writers write, how come fingers don't fing.

If the plural of tooth is teeth

Shouldn't the plural of phone booth be phone beeth

If the teacher taught,

Why didn't the preacher praught.

If a vegetarian eats vegetables

What the heck does a humanitarian eat!?

Why do people recite at a play

Yet play at a recital?

Park on driveways and

Drive on parkways

How can the weather be as hot as hell on one day

And as cold as hell on another

You have to marvel at the unique lunacy

Of a language where a house can burn up as

It burns down

And in which you fill in a form

By filling it out

And a bell is only heard once it goes!

English was invented by people, not computers

And it reflects the creativity of the human race

(Which of course isn't a race at all)

That is why

When the stars are out they are visible

But when the lights are out they are invisible

And why it is that when I wind up my watch

It starts

But when I wind up this poem

It ends.",Jokes

Being accepted into the Baptist church requires a tough test.,"The minister meets with three married couples who want to join the Baptist Church. The first couple are retirees from Florida, the second couple are in their early 40s, and the last couple are newlyweds, having been married only 3 weeks. ""We have developed a small test for those who want to join, I'm afraid.  You must go without having sex for 2 weeks ... and if you succeed, then you will welcome you with open arms.""  

The three couples shake the minister's hand and leave, determined to meet this test.

Two weeks later, the three couples return and meet with the minister in his office.  ""Did you succeed in your test?"" he asks the first couple.

""Yes sir, we did.  We have not had sex in 2 weeks.""  The older husband and wife beamed at the minister, and he shook their hands and welcomed them to the church.

Moving to the second couple, he asks the same question.  The middle-aged couple look at each other, and say ""Yes sir ... we struggled a bit with it, but we have managed not to have sex for 2 weeks as you requested.""  The minister smiled, shook their hands, and welcomed them to the church.

Then, he approached the newlywed couple, both in their early 20s.  ""My friends, did you pass the test?""  The couple, shame-faced, look at each other before the husband answers, ""I'm afraid not, pastor.  We did really well the first 3 days, but on the fourth day, my wife bent over to pick up a can of corn and I just happened to be behind her, and before I knew it, we were having sex right then and there.  I'm very sorry,"" he said, hanging his head.  

Frowning, the minister said, ""I understand, but I'm afraid you won't be able to join our church.""

"Each Friday night after work, Bubba would fire up his outdoor grill","and cook a venison steak. But all of Bubba's neighbors were Catholic....and since it was Lent, they were forbidden from eating meat on Friday.

The delicious aroma from the grilled venison steaks was causing such a problem for the Catholic faithful that they finally talked to their priest.  The Priest came to visit Bubba and suggested that he become a Catholic. After several classes and much study, Bubba attended Mass.....and as the priest sprinkled holy water over him, he said, ""You were born a Baptist, and raised a Baptist, but now you are a Catholic.""

Bubba's neighbors were greatly relieved, until Friday night arrived, and the wonderful aroma of grilled venison again filled the neighborhood. The Priest was called immediately by the neighbors and as he rushed into Bubba's yard clutching a rosary preparing to scold him, he stopped and watched in amazement.  There stood Bubba, clutching a small bottle of holy water which he carefully sprinkled over the grilling meat and chanted:

A monastery decides to open up a nursing home for the disabled,"The home was built and word quickly spread of its luxuriousness. It was clean, well staffed, had the needs for every customer/patient, and the food was just amazing.

It was such a success, people from all around the world came just to feel relaxed and catered for, even with their disability. 

Soon the media started qriting articles too. Boozefeed, The Big Broadcasting Company, and many other reliable unbiased news companies started writing articles, and sent reporters to this nursing home.

The monks there decided to give them all a tour, and made their fellow monk Karl the head tour leader, and he decided to go through each section of the nursing home and explain what they do.

The reporters arrived, eager to start, but Karl was calm, and took them through without any hesitation.

""Here is the common area, where our can patients relax, play games or watch tv, there are ramps and elevators all over the facility and as you can see this area is the most congested, so we have 3 seperate common rooms to accommodate everyone.""

""Here is the hallway that leads to the 5 different 'types' of disabilities, where people who have the same disability come to live together.""

""The first one is for the people who have lost their sense of sight, they have Braille books and the light is always turned off to save electricity.""

""The second room is for people who have lost their sense in general. This is for people who suffer from mind issues, from ptsd to dementia.They have relaxing music playing and many staff to tend to their every need""

""The third room is for people who have lost their sense of touch, and have lost a limb or more. They have accessible toilets and very cozy floors and couches, as well as comfy wheelchair covers""

""The fourth room is for people who have lost their sense of hearing, they have quite normal rooms, but announcements are made using the large tv, and there are many clocks around with sections telling you what thing you are meant to be doing""

As they neared the fifth room, the reporters noticed that there were only women in the rooms.

A new guy starts work at a bakery,"A new guy starts work at a bakery.

He's handed his rota and his eyes lighten up: ""Great, it's dinner-roll day!"". The supervisor is puzzled to see such enthusiasm for so mundane a task as baking dinner rolls, but sure enough, the new guy goes to it with zest and panache and is soon turning out dinner rolls the like of which the supervisor has never seen or tasted, imaginatively designed and with a taste and texture beyond all praise or even description.

It's the same again the next day when the new guy comes in and looks at the rota: ""Wow, wholemeal loaf day!"". And sure enough, he puts the same verve and expertise into making wholemeal loaves as he did into dinner rolls the day before, and soon they are selling like something for which there ought to be a suitable simile when you're telling a story about a bakery.

On the Wednesday he takes one look at the words ""Danish Pastry day"" on the rota and immediately bursts into song, turning out tray after tray of beautifully formed and succulent Danish pastries, and on Thursday the excited shriek of ""Doughnut day! Yes!!!"" heralds an eight-hour shift of doughnuts that God Himself would forgive the sins of a whole world for.

3 brothers enter the hospital room of their dying parents who have lived a long life of exploring and treasure hunting.,"Their parents greet them, and tell them of the last adventure they were unable to complete. “There’s a cave down in South America, deep in the jungles of Brazil. Go there and find the treasure we have been searching for the last 20 years. We know the three of you will find it.” 

The brothers leave to prepare for their journey, their hearts heavy from their parents passing, but set with vindictive courage determined to find this mysterious cave. 

3 years later the brothers are hopeless, having found no evidence of such a cave in the Brazilian jungles. They make it back to their parents house eventually... where they find a little glass bottle on top of the fridge, with a scroll rolled up inside. 

The first brother uncorks the bottle and gets the scroll out, starting to unroll it. *crinkle crinkle* The paper is very brittle.

On it reveals a clear path through Brazil to where this mysterious cave might be. They only wish they knew about this treasure map 3 years ago... but alas, their journey begins.

Finally, within the Brazilian forests they arrive at the steps of a vine-encased stairway surrounded by foliage. There is no sign or anything, but this is where their parents’ treasure map led them to. 

The brothers take each other by hand and begin to descend. After what seems like 1,000 steps they finally reach a dim torch-lit room with three doors. One door has a fire symbol. One door has a water symbol. And the last door has a question mark.

Bewildered by these symbols the first brother decides to take one for the team and enters the fire door. It slams  behind him as he descends another 1,000 stairs. Finally reaching the bottom he finds red Rubies scattered about the floor in piles he could never have imagined! He begins gathering rubies into sacks he brought and once he picks up the last ruby.. he notices a fireball start to form in the corner of the room. So he lifts his sacks in an adrenaline-fueled rush and bee-lines it for the door, 1,000 stairs up. He just barely makes it out, slamming the door on the fireball behind him. 

His brothers are impressed by his riches that he gathered! While also afraid that the fire door housed a killer fireball. But the second brother can’t be outdone by the first.

He makes his way down the stairs of the water symbol door. Making it to the bottom of the steps he finds sapphires scattered everywhere and begins to gather them up. He picks up the last sapphire and water immediately begins seeping in from all corners of the room... In a rushed panic he picks up his sacks of sapphires and trudges through the water, barely making it up the stairs and closing the door before the water level rose enough to kill him and his brothers. 

The third brother is now wildly impressed with his first two brothers’ riches! And also terrified to open this third door and see what evils may linger behind a question mark symbol. 

He gathers up some courage and enters. This time there are only 10 steps. He finds rubies, sapphires, emeralds, and diamonds galore! There are so many treasures he fills up 4, 5, 6 enormous sacks of gems and.. nothing happens. He picks up his treasures and barely manages to make it up those 10 steps with all the extra weight. 

His brothers are ASTOUNDED. How did you get all that treasure?! Why did nothing attack YOU?! 

Nevertheless, the boys returned home with their respective treasures, feeling fulfilled by completing their parents goal. 

The first brother celebrates by buying a nice house on a lake in Texas, getting all sorts of fun toys and things to play with considering his newfound fortune. Years go by, and one day there is a gas leak in his kitchen. As he leans in to examine the issue, a fireball explodes in his face and kills him in a fiery death.

The very same day years later, the second brother was out enjoying a margarita on the beach, in front of his new beach mansion. Those sapphires really paid off for him to live a stress free life! That is until a tsunami forms faster than ever and engulfs the beach, claiming the second brother’s life before he or his margarita knew it. 

Now the third brother hears about the tragic deaths of his brothers.. and recalls the fire door, and the water door which relate to his brothers’ deaths. Since he doesn’t know what to expect he begins to prepare for the worst. As he had saved his jewels and not lived an extravagant lifestyle the past few years, he had plenty of wealth to invest in a castle with a drawbridge and an alligator moat. An entire team of armed guards was set up for 24 hour lookout and protection. 

Weeks go by and there is no cause for any alarm. Until one day where he gets a dispatch on his Walkie-talkie, “Psshhhhk- hello sir, you may want to have a look at this.. uh, I’m not sure how else to describe it. We have identified a.. floating coffin? It seems to be headed in our direction at a steady pace.. just ominously floating.”

The brother immediately heads to the lookout tower to get a glimpse through binoculars. And then he sees it. The floating coffin has a big question mark on the front of it.. floating directly towards him 1,000 meters away. He immediately recognizes this as the question mark on the door where he found his treasures. 

In a panic, he yells into his walkie talkie, “Psshhhk- ATTENTION ALL GUARDS, DO NOT LET THAT THING INTO THIS CASTLE. OPEN FIRE, RAISE THE DRAWBRIDGE! DO ANYTHING YOU HAVE TO DO TO PROTECT ME!!” 

He then makes his way to the deepest, most secluded portion of his castle, ending up in a guest bathroom underground where he was holed up waiting for his fate to arrive. 

His guards radio in as he starts to hear rumbling and crashing upstairs above him. 

“Psshhhk- SIR! Sir.. we can’t stop it. Our bullets just bounce off of it! It just floated over the moat and crashed through our drawbridge!! It is coming for you.. we can———“ and the walkie falls silent. 

In a panic the brother starts to look for anything he might be able to use to defend himself... he really is at a disadvantage in this guest bathroom as all he can find is an old rusty razor and a bottle of NyQuil. He thinks just maybe he could try and slice at it with the razor and maybe use the bottle of NyQuil as a projectile. 

Soon enough, he hears the coffin crashing through the outer door, and CRASH the bathroom door shatters into pieces as the big question mark fills his view. Quickly, he throws the bottle of NyQuil and lunges at the coffin with the razor in hand... but he swings at nothing.. the coffin had vanished into thin air as soon as the NyQuil made contact. 

And that’s when he realized.. NyQuil stops the coffin.",Jokes

Once upon a time in a kingdom,"Once upon a time in a kingdom, there lived a queen who was a tramp(had multiple sexual partners all the time). The king was frustrated by this but couldn't do anything because she was extremely beautiful. One day the king had to leave for war but he knew that his wife would have sex with a lot of men in his absence, so the clever king inserted a blade in her vagina before leaving. A few weeks later the king returned from the victorious war, and a lot of joy and pomp was observed in the village. After getting back the king had to know how many people had sex with his wife, so he went to every house in the kingdom and pulled down the pants and underwear of every man in the house. To his disappointment everyone's dick was cut off because of the blade; from the peasants and farmers to the chief minister and advisors, all had their dicks cutt off because every man in the kingdom had sex with the queen. The king was infuriated and very dissapointed, as he was inspecting the last houses of the kingdom, he came across a man who's dick was intact. It was a very small penis but it  wasn't cut. Seeing this, the king became extremely happy and impressed by him and he said,""I am proud of you, young man! you have proven to be the most loyal person in this kingdom!

Man on the mountain,"One day on a nearby mountain a man stood atop it. He looked at the view and turned his pockets inside out. Powdered gold gushed out at amazing speed as he stood there.

Soon the media caught wind of this and went to investigate. After stuffing as many buckets of gold into their van as they could they set out to find the man. This journey was not easy, the powdered gold made the mountain slick, and difficult to climb, but eventually they found the man.

In the interview they asked him how it was he was doing this and why.

""Well, a while back i found a hobo who looked in stress i gave him a 100 bucks. He turned to me and said for your kindness ill grant you 3 wishes. The first wish was to have deep pockets. The second was to be able to escape from any situation. The third was to screw over the government.""

You could now see thousands of people coming to collect gold, helicopters on the horizon, even police were shoving buckets and pales into the glistening shiny sand.

""Thats amazing"" said the interviewer, ""but that still doesnt explain something, where did all of this gold come from?""

From the helicopters could be heard, ""your under arrest""

The man replied, ""oh thats easy, fort knox depository!""",Jokes

Confused at first one of the nuns later realized that those colors perfectly matched the colors of their underwear. She mentioned her discovery to the other two nuns, but both were reluctant to believe that could be possible.

The next day, they all wore black underwear and passed in front of the house. ""Black, black, black,” the parrot screeched. Hearing that, the three nuns were astonished!!

One of the nuns spoke up: ""Girls, tomorrow we are going to trick that bird.” They agreed that the next day none of them would wear any underwear under their vestments.

The following day came and, as they walked by the house, the parrot looked a bit puzzled. He swung back and forth on the cane he was perched on.

One tribe learned the skills of architecture, and traded designs for safe grass buildings with neighboring tribes for other necessities, such as food and animal pelts. Over time, the tribe grew quite rich, and without the need for goods the chief of the tribe demanded payment in the form of a tribute, an ornate throne. Over time the number of thrones the chief owned grew more and more numerous, so he had a great multi-story grass house built to store all of his thrones. One day, the weight of the thrones became so much the house collapsed, killing the chief. The moral of the story is… wait for it…

In the distance is a third cauldron. It’s much bigger, and is glowing, white hot. The American can barely get near it. Nonetheless, at Satan’s insistence, he approaches it and peers in. It is absolutely packed with souls, barely visible, under the surface of the boiling liquid. Now and then, however, one clambers out of the pitch and desperately reaches for the rim. Oddly, there are no devils sitting on the edge of this giant pot, but the clamberer disappears back under the surface anyway. The American asks, “Why are there no demons here to keep everyone from escaping?” Satan replies, “This is where we put the Russians. If one tries to escape, the others pull him back in.”",Jokes

The most famous podcast,"Olga was a famous blogger but wanted to start something new. She tried Vlog, she tried all different art forms but realised that speaking was her art and the voice her best instrument.

What should I do? Thinks Olga! How can I make the most famous podcast?

Olga on her research sees that she needs to go specialized  , speaking of something no one ever speaks about, like maybe pools or swimmers; something water related, she also wants to stimulate the audience maybe with some questions.

Also she thinks she should bounce her ideas off with someone fresh, someone that never heard about this specialized matter and that would provide freshness and banter and naturally be the voice of the listener during the podcast.

Olga puts some ads and tries to find the best co host and has to go far, to Malaysia to find Xion, an adorable guy who she feels naturally vibing with.

Drinking and driving.,"Drinking and Driving

 

            I would like to share a personal experience with my

friends about drinking and driving. This might save you the cost and

embarrassment of being arrested for DUI.

            As you know, people have been known to have

unexpected brushes with the authorities from time to time, often on the way

home after a ""social session"" with  family or friends. Well, this year, it

happened to me. I was out for the evening to a party and had more than

several margaritas coupled with a bottle of rather nice red wine. It was

held at a great Mexican restaurant. Although relaxed, I still had the common

sense to know I was slightly over the limit. That's when I did something

I've never done before...I took a taxi home.  On the way home there was a

police roadblock, but since it was a taxi they waved it past and I arrived

home safely without incident. These roadblocks can be anywhere and I

realized how lucky I was to have chosen to take a taxi. The real

surprise to me was I had never driven a taxi before. I don't know where

I got it, and now that it's in my garage I don't know what to do with it.

Jeffrey and Hillary were both patients at a mental hospital.,"One day while they were walking past the hospital swimming pool, Jeffrey suddenly jumped into the deep end. He sank to the bottom of the pool and stayed there. Hillary promptly jumped in to save him. She swam to the bottom and pulled Jeffrey out.

When the Head Nurse became aware of Hillary's heroic act she immediately ordered her to be discharged from the hospital, as she now considered her to be mentally stable.

When she went to tell Hillary the news she said, ""Hillary, I have good news and bad news.

Twas the week before Christmas,"‘Twas the Week before Christmas
by Canttake Itany Moore

‘Twas the week before Christmas and all through the city
The virus still raged. The year was still shitty.
The cars sat snuggly, all still in the street.
There was no place to go. No friends to meet.
Restaurants were closed. There was no place to dine.
Gifts were all bought, but from only online.
We all wore our masks and had so far survived
But there still were late presents that hadn't arrived.
I threw open the door, from the weather I shivered,
Looking to see if the gifts were delivered.
And then from my TV I heard on the news
The government had granted emergency use!
I sprang to my feet and gave a big whoop
And texted my friends who were out of the loop.
First Pfizer, then Moderna, with others real soon
All will be vaccinated, come around June!
I got on my Facebook and put on my wall,
""Vaccinate, Vaccinate, Vaccinate All!""
And then from outside, I heard a loud truck
And hoped that my boxes had come- with some luck.
As I stuck out my head, and was looking around,
Out of his truck the Amazon guy came with a bound.
He was dressed all in blue with a bright yellow ""A"",
A man on a mission, with no time for play.
His eyes- how very tired! His shoulders, how slumped!
His stride was quite slow. As he moved, how he grumped!
He was exhausted and tired, an overworked elf,
And I sighed when I saw him, in spite of myself.
The bags under his eyes and his general grog
Soon gave me to know he was worked like a dog.
He spoke not a word, but walked straight to the back,
Where he grabbed all the boxes- quite a large stack.
While still on the sidewalk, he tossed them left-handed,
And onto my doorstep they clunkily landed.
He jumped in his truck and turned on the ignition,
Then away he sped off to finish his mission.
But I heard him exclaim, as he drove out of view
""Merry Christmas to all, but to Covid, Fuck you!""",Jokes

""Whew!"" he sighed.

As luck would have it, there was a mechanic in town, and he told the penguin that he'd have to spend some time with the car. ""Why don't you come back in an hour or so?""

Wiping the sweat from his brow, the penguin espied an ice cream shoppe! ""Hurray and yippy!"" he cried! ""I'll be back, toot sweet!"" he said.

He ordered the tallest vanilla ice cream he could hold between his vestigial wings... those miserable fins could barely manage the scoops upon scoops of creamy goodness. The cone was so tall that more of it ended up on the penguin than in him!

""Yummy! That was very very good!"" the penguin said, smacking his lips.

He waddled back to the mechanic who was ready to give the little fellow an update. The mechanic looked at the penguin sternly. The gaskets and seals on the engine were severely damaged after years of driving without a routine check, and it was certainly going to be expensive.

""Well, it looks like you blew a seal.""

Although he experienced low approval numbers during the lockdowns, he recently hit his highest approval rating of his career, due to America's excellent performance in preventing the spread of COVID in hindsight, after seeing how European countries like Sweden performed.

In addition, despite losing the house and senate in the 2018 midterms, the Obama administration managed to narrowly pass a bipartisan resolution granting citizenship to any people from Hong Kong who entered the United States.

With the passage of this bill, Obama invited over a hundred recently naturalized Hong Kongers to Washington for his State of the Union, to show that America is a country of immigrants, and express his pride of what Congress managed to achieve.

Obama steps up on the podium ready to give his speech. He pauses for a brief moment, and looks at the politicians all around him. He then looks at the hundred Asian citizens in the front of the audience, and shows a slight smile.

He angles his mic, and is now ready to begin his speech.

I went home to my 11th floor apartment, and I searched all over, but I couldn't find anyone else inside.  I finally found him on the edge of our balcony.

""But he landed in some bushes!  He broke his legs, but he was still alive.  I had to finish him off.  I went back inside and dragged the refrigerator to the balcony.  I tipped it over the railing, and it landed on the man and killed him.  But all the exertion gave me a heart attack, and I died right there.""

Peter says, ""that's horrible, go on in.""

**The second man** says, ""I was doing some maintenance on my 12th-floor apartment balcony, when the wind caught me and I fell over.  Luckily, I caught the balcony of the apartment below me.  I saw the owner come, and I thought he was going to help me up, but instead he starts punching and kicking me!  I was barely able to hang on.  Then he brought a hammer and smashed my fingers, and I couldn't hang on anymore.  Luckily, I landed in some bushes, but I broke my legs and couldn't go for help.  Before I could drag myself away, a refrigerator drops on me!  That's when I died.""

A guy sits at a bar in a skyscraper restaurant high above the city.,"A guy sits at a bar in a skyscraper restaurant high above the city. He slams a shot of tequila, goes over to the window and jumps out.

The guy sitting next to him can’t believe what he just saw. He’s more surprised when, 10 minutes later, the same guy walks back into the bar and sits down next to him.

The astonished onlooker asks, “How did you do that? I just saw you jump out the window, and we’re hundreds of feet above the ground!”

The jumper responds by slurring, “Well, I don’t get it either. I slam a shot of tequila, and when I jump out the window, the tequila makes me slow down right before I hit the ground. Watch.” He takes a shot, goes to the window and jumps out.

The other guy runs to the window and watches as the guy falls to just above the sidewalk, slows down and lands softly on his feet. A few minutes later, the jumper walks back into the bar.

The other guy has to try it, too, so he orders a shot of tequila. He slams it and jumps out the window. As he reaches the bottom, he doesn’t slow down at all. SPLAT!

The first guy orders another shot of tequila. The bartender shakes his head in denial and said, “You’re really an a**hole when you’re drunk, Superman.”",Jokes

I have been finding real passion with Stacy and she is so nice.

tight motorcycle clothes and the fact that she is much older than I am.

Stacy said that we will be very happy. 

She owns a trailer in the woods and has a stack of firewood
for the whole winter. We share a dream of having many more children. 

Stacy has opened my eyes to the fact that marijuana doesn't really hurt anyone. 

We'll be growing it for ourselves and trading it with the
other people that live nearby for cocaine and ecstasy. 

In the meantime we will pray that science will find a cure 
for AIDS so Stacy can get better. She deserves it.

He pointed to a door and said “Voodoo dildo, the door.”

The voodoo dildo rose out of its box, darted over to the door, and started screwing the keyhole. The whole door shook with the vibrations, and a crack developed down the middle. Before the door could split, the old man said, “Voodoo dildo, box!”

The voodoo dildo stopped, floated back to the box and lay there, motionless.

The businessman said, “I’ll take it!”

The guy took it home to his wife, told her it was a special dildo and that to use it, all she had to do was say, “Voodoo dildo, my pussy.”

He left for his trip satisfied things would be fine while he was gone.

After he’d been gone a few days, the wife was unbearably horny. She thought of several people who would willingly satisfy her, but then she remembered the voodoo dildo. She lay down, placed the box between her legs, and said “Voodoo dildo, my pussy!” The voodoo dildo shot to her crotch and started pumping. It was great, like nothing she’d ever experienced before.

After three orgasms, she decided she’d had enough, and tried to pull it out, but it was stuck in her, still thrusting. She tried and tried to get it out, but nothing worked. Her husband had forgot to tell her how to shut it off! So she decided to go to the hospital to see if they could help. She put her clothes on, got in the car and started to drive to the hospital, quivering with every thrust of the dildo. On the way, another orgasm nearly made her swerve off the road, and she was pulled over by a policeman. He asked for her license, and then asked how much she’d had to drink. Gasping and twitching, she explained that she hadn’t been drinking, but that a voodoo dildo was stuck in her pussy, and wouldn’t stop screwing her.

The officer looked at her for a second, and then said, “Yeah, right. Voodoo dildo, my ass!""",Jokes

"[OC] Our weird, predictable cat","When we adopted Whiskers, she was just six weeks old.  She was the curious / explorer type, so often we'd suddenly realize that we hadn't seen her in a while.  Thankfully, the shelter had suggested shaking a container of treats to try to get her attention.  Sure enough, when we shook that bottle, she'd come trotting in - sometimes covered in cobwebs, leaving us to wonder where she'd been exploring.  Eventually, she got less interested in the treats, but we found something new.  


She became fascinated by using little pretzel sticks as toys.  And she soon learned what sound the cabinet we kept those in made when we opened it - so just like the treats, she'd come bolting in from anywhere in the house when she heard that.  Great, we still had a way to call our cat out from hiding.  


Of course, being a cat, she also had a penchant for turkey.  It took her no time at all to figure out that it was kept in the refrigerator.  This was a much bigger interest than the pretzels, so this worked for years even when she stopped responding to the sound of the cabinet door opening.  If we couldn't find her, all we had to do was open the fridge, and bam, she's galloping into the kitchen.  And, being an adorable little weirdo, she really took to ice cream as well.  So even opening the freezer door would be enough for us to locate her in a pinch.  


In fact, we can *still* find her just by opening the freezer door, and that hasn't changed in 45 years.",Jokes

The Turkey Pardon,"Scenario: This year's turkey pardoning. 

The stage is set, the lights are warm, and the fingers are poised to hit the shutter. Trump emerges and stands ready, with a sparkle in his eye. 

The turkey is presented. It's a plump beast with odd colorings. The usual brown plumage is a bit tanner. The cute red tie seems to enhance its already powerful strut. The wisps of hair atop its head are slicked back haphazardly. All make a splended scario for the shutterbugs. The ceremony begins. 

Trump includes all the expected pageantry in his speech. This turkey, trump explains, has been treated very badly. The worst, actually, out of any turkey's that ever lived. Pardoning this turkey is only right, he explains to the crowd. 

Trump is presented with the paperwork. The cameras snap away as he signs the sheet. Polite applause raises from the crowd. Trump proudly presents the signed paperwork as proof of the deed for the media to capture, but a shriek from the crowd turns the mood. Two people now stand, now five, all pointing towards Trump, in horror. A camera focuses in on the still ink-wet pardon. The turkey's name... is Donald John Trump.",Jokes

Land of the Trids,"In a distant land lives a large village of little people called ""Trids"", whom are peaceful, prosperous, and eat, drink and be merry.

Suddenly one day a giant, whom they've never seen before, comes stomping through the village, stepping on buildings, Trids, vehicles, and generally causing mayhem, but otherwise just continues on through and leaves the village.

Villagers gather and discuss ""What was that!"", ""Where did he come from"", and so forth.  With no answers to be had, they clean up and go back to their lives.

The next day, the same giant comes stomping through the village, causing destruction as he passes through.

The villagers find the Sheriff and tell him to go confront the giant and get him to stop doing this.

Hours later the Sheriff returns all beaten up, on death's door, and can only say ""the giant lives on the great hill way over yonder"" before passing.

The next day, the giant again stomps through the village, as expected.

The villagers tell the Mayor that he must go to the hill where the giant lives and put an end to this madness.

The mayor never returns.

As you can guess, the next day the giant again walks through the village, leaving a wake of disaster in his path.

The villagers gather and tell the Rabbi that he must go to the giant and try to find out why the giant is doing this.

The Rabbi agrees.  He says his goodbyes to all, and makes peace with the likelihood that he too will not return.

The Rabbi walks to the great hill and climbs it.  He finds the giant there, and cautiously approaches him.

The Rabbi says ""Great giant, I request you to please tell me why every day you walk through our village and leave death and hardship in your path"".

The giant goes towards the Rabbi and says ""Silly Rabbi; Trids are for kicks!"" and kicks the Rabbi off the great hill.",Jokes
The Big Bang Theory,"# Some Background Info

The TV show ""The Big Bang Theory"" was created by Chuck Lorre.  At the end of each episode he inserted a one screen humorous comment.

While season 4 was being produced, the lead actress had a horseback riding accident unrelated to the show which caused her a broken leg. This of course caused havoc with continuing production. In the season 4 episode 7 in 2010, Mr. Lorre posted:

# CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS, #309

Following Kaley Cuoco's horseback riding injury, I've instituted new rules governing acceptable leisure activities for the cast of The Big Bang Theory.

1. No friggin' horses. This includes those found on merry-go-rounds and in front of supermarkets.

2. The only motorcycle you can get on is the one you're accidentally crushing in your big-ass, air-bagged SUV. 

3. All cast member motor vehicles must adhere to U.S. Army guidelines for attacking Kandahar. (Galecki's Tesla is a terrifically fuel efficient vehicle but is essentially a hundred thousand dollar go-cart. From now on it is only to be used for backing down his driveway and retrieving mail.) 

4. The only permissible boating activity at Comic-Con is in your hotel room bathtub. 

5. Alcohol should only be ingested at home, and while seated in a big comfy chair. Wild and carefree dancing that celebrates your incredible and well-deserved success is only allowed on New Year's Eve, and only with a sober celebrity parasitic flunky to lean on. 

6. And finally, sexual acts must be performed while horizontal. Certain high-risk Kama Sutra positions might be allowed, but only after consultation with Chuck Lorre. Like with dancing, a spotter might be required.",Jokes

A different game of thrones,"Long ago a then famous reporter of the times traveled to a little known kingdom deep in the heart of Africa, accompanied by translators and bearers of course.  It was not very technologically advanced, with no plumbing and clay and stray being the primary building materials.

Upon arrival he was greeted and welcomed by the kingdom elders, for they are a friendly people.

They exchanged pleasantries and the reporter explained ""I've come to learn about your kingdom and the people here, and to spread that knowledge to the rest of the world.""

The elders all agreed that was a fine idea and one said ""We are happy for the world to know more about our kingdom, but to really know our people, you must get to know our king.""

""That's great!  May I start with asking you elders a few questions?"" said the reporter.

""Yes, ask your questions."" agreed an elder.

The reporter asked ""Does your kingdom have much trouble with the other kingdoms nearby?  I've heard that some of them can be very warlike.""

""We do not, but to understand our peace, you must understand our king.""

This went on for a while, with each answer again referring to the king.

Taking the 'hint', the reporter asked ""Please, kind people, may I speak with your great King?""

An elder explained ""Perhaps you may, but you may only speak with the king if he holds a dinner feast in your honor, which he will only do if you give him a gift of a throne"", nodding as he finished.

""A throne?  I don't understand.  Surely your king already has a throne to sit upon?"" puzzled the reporter.

""Our king has many thrones, and he sits upon whichever he chooses, whenever he chooses as is the way of Kings.  He collects thrones.  It is his passion and the main part of why you must understand our king to understand our people.  Prepare to gift a throne to our king in three days time at his hut for a dinner feast in your honor, or be forever banished from our lands."" said an elder.

""I understand"" was all the reporter could say.

He hastily arranged for a throne to be delivered by the appointed time.

When the day and time for the honors arrived, the reporter went to the Kings hut with the throne being carried by four men.

""Your Majesty, I have brought you a gift of a throne, that we may speak so I can learn of you and your kingdom and all the people in it, and tell the world of your greatness"" called out the reporter.

The king appeared.  Upon seeing the gift of the throne, the king welcomed the reporter and all with him into his home, and commanded the throne to be taken to one of the upper floors and the dinner feast to begin.

Unfortunately, with the weight of this new throne along with all the others the king had accumulated over his reign, the hut collapsed killing the king, the reporter, and all others inside.

Your life pursuit,"Long ago in a distant land an explorer and his large team of bearers, trackers, hunters, cooks, handymen, translators and so on came upon a village of people never before known to the outside world.

Luckily the translators were able to communicate with the people and soon the explorer was talking with the villagers, whom called themselves ... well, nevermind that as it's unpronounceable by outsiders.

The explorer offered the villagers gifts of whatever he had with him.  To his astonishment, the villagers chose things that were the most mundane and least valuable to the team.

As the villagers were each coming to choose their gifts, the explorer observed that each of them had many white and grey spots and drips on their bodies and clothes (what clothes they wore, anyway), and that each of them had an odd and slightly unpleasant odor about them.  The older the villager, the more spots on their person, and there was a very high portion of elderly people, of well advanced age.

As the last of the villagers trickled by, the explorer spoke with the representatives of the village.  He asked about why they all chose the least valuable items.

The representatives said ""Walk with us, and see our land as we speak"", to which the explorer agreed, bringing several of his team along.

As they walked, the explorer noticed that the growth and good abundance of this land was vastly superior to all other land he'd ever seen in all of his travels around the world.

""We are a simple and happy people. All we need is provided to us by the great Foo in the sky, whom we do not anger.""

The explorer obviously recognized this as being some spiritual mumbo jumbo, but of course held his tongue and remained polite.

Just then, the explorer observed out of the corner of his eye one of his team collapsing.  Upon inspection, the team member was dead!

The explorer was concerned and asked the villagers if they knew what happened.

""He angered the great Foo in the sky"" was all they said.

The explorer had already found the villagers to be warm and friendly, so he was sure there was no foul play and the team member must have stepped on something, or been bitten by a small poisonous creature, or the like.

They continued walking and talking.  Thinking of the odor he'd noticed from the people, the explorer offered ""Can I give you the gift of soap and teach you how to make it?""

""We are a simple people, but we know of soap.  We do not anger the great Foo in the sky.""

While he contemplated this, another one of his team fell over, also dead!

""Kindly villagers, would you please tell me what is killing my team members?""

""He angered the great Foo in the sky"" they solemnly said.

It was obvious to the explorer that the villagers are superstitious and clueless, but he couldn't help thinking about the fact that there were so many elderly in the village.

As he was thinking to himself, he spotted an unusually large bird soaring in the sky rather far above them.

What could be killing his men so readily, but has not killed the villagers such that there are so many elders.

Looking up at the very large bird the explorer asked ""What type of bird is that?""

While the villager answered ""That is Foo"" a bird turd landed on the explorers shoulder.

The explorer moved his hand to brush the bird turd off of him, but the villager quickly grabbed his arm and said ""Do not anger the great Foo in the sky.""

The Horse Challenge (LONG)," Every year, during fair season, a local farmer takes his horse and sets up a booth at various fairs. The rules are simple and the reward is great; make his horse nod yes and then shake his head no- doing this earns a $500 prize. 

  As it so happens fair season is in full swing, and the farmer is making a killing at $5 per attempt. A young man named Johnny decided to check out the festivities this year. He was strolling through, checking out the games, rides, food, and happens to see a pretty lengthy line for this one event. Johnny stops and asks an older gentleman in line what’s going on, and he learns about the “horse challenge”.

  He thinks to himself, “nothing to lose, ought to be fun”. Eventually he makes his way to the front and it’s finally his turn. He walks into the pen eying the horse and sizing him up. He pauses, looks at the farmer and asks, “any rules?”. The farmer replies, “nope, make ‘em say yes or no.” 

  With that Johnny faces the horse, strolls over to the wooden fence, and picks up two halves of a brick. He then casually walks up to the horse, and with one brick smacks the horses left nut, causing the horse to raise his head up and down in pain. Johnny then claps the horses right nut making the beast shake his head violently left, and then right. The farmer begrudgingly hands Johnny his winnings and packs up shop, moving to the next fair.

  The farmer is hitting his last event of the season, and is now charging $10 per attempt and increased the prize to $1000. Again, Johnny is at this same fair and notices the event. Eventually it’s his turn, but the farmer remembers him from last time and tells him, he can only speak to the horse, can’t use any objects or make any crazy movements. Johnny agrees to the terms and steps into the wooden pen once again.

  As before, he eyeballs the horse and it stares back at him. Johnny walks up to the great beast, looks him dead in the eyes, and asks the horse, “you member me?” To which the creature slowly nods his head yes. “Want me to get them bricks?” The horse shakes his head from left to right very quickly. Jonny collects his winnings and is forever banned from attempting that farmers event.",Jokes

These many weeks pass, and his son returns, but to his surprise, the son says ""I believe that the Jewish religion is not the one true belief, and therefore I will now be a Christian!""

The father, enraged, goes to his Rabbi, and asks him for guidance. The rabbi replied:  ""I will have to look into this further. I will send my son to the Holy land as well and see what he does.""

Several weeks later, the rabbi's son arrives home, and also says ""Dear Father, thanks to your guidance, I have journeyed to the Holy Land, and have come to the conclusion that Christianity is the one true religion.""

The rabbi, also enraged, suggests to all of those who listen to him, to travel to the holy land and seek answers. All of those who did returned as a Christian.

The rabbi, having finally lost it, shouts out loud into the air and asks ""Why, God, why, does everybody who travels to the holy land, renounce their faith and accept Christianity as the one true religion?""

Two guys walking in the forest and find a hole,"They look down its cavernous depths and are amazed that they can't see the bottom.

So one of them tosses a small piece of tree branch in. They wait and wait and there is no sound of it hitting the bottom.

The other one forages around and finds a good sized rock and tosses it in. They wait and wait, and there is still no sound of it hitting the bottom! 

The two of them are quite amazed and start looking around for even bigger things to drop in. One finds an larger rock and tosses it in. Nothing. The other finds a broken off portion of a tree stump and hauls it in. Still nothing.

The two of them by this point are getting extremely curious and even a little bit scared so they look around for something even bigger to throw in. After walking a bit one of them spies a chunk of metal that upon further inspection appears to be a railroad tie.

The two of them heave and ho and manage to haul it over into the hole. And there is still no sound!

The two of them decide they have had enough and turn around and start walking out of the forest.

Just as they start walking a goat comes running toward them at incredible speed, baa'ing furiously, and then dives head first straight into the hole. (Still no sound).

The two shoot each other a ""WTF?"" look and continue walking. A few minutes later a man dressed like a farmer comes walking by and says, ""Have you two seen my goat around here?"" 

One of the men says, ""Well, actually, yes, it was so bizarre, we just saw a goat run by us and dive into this hole back there!""

I visited my grandfather in an old folks home: Part 2,"Part 1: We sat down at a table in the cafeteria and started to chat.  He said things were going okay but sounded a little frustrated. 

Just then he starts to lean over, almost off his chair, when a nurse rushes over and straightens him back up. My grandfather mumbled something under his breath.

We keep talking and I’m trying to get to the bottom of why he’s upset when he starts to lean over again, quickly a nurse comes over and straightens him back up. What great service I thought.

A little time passes and he still won’t tell me what’s the matter when he starts to lean over again, just like before, a nurse rushes over and straightens him up. 
 
Finally he bursts out, “You wanna know what the matter is?! That nurse won’t let me FART!!”

The funniest joke in the World,"Joke about a goat.

One guy is walking down the dirt road. He sees a field and a big cavity in the ground. The hole is so big that he can't see the bottom. He is very interested so he step closer to the hole. He took a small rock and threw it in the pit. He's listening... nothing happened. 

Then he took a lot bigger rock. He could barely lift it up. He threw it in and is listening... ... ... nothing. 

He can't see or hear anything. He is very disturbed. He managed to find a very big stone. He can't lift it up alone so he asked another guy that was walking near by to help him. They throw the stone together into the black hole... ... ... ... ... nothing happens... again. Man sits near the hole feeling depressed. 

""Kurwa... what the hell. There is a hole in the ground and I can't figure out what is happening.""

The other guy is also troubled but shortly he went away. Suddenly the man has a great idea! He spotted a train rail. He will throw it down the pit. The rail will hit either bottom or walls of the pit. He will hear something for sure! The guy is fighting to pull the rail. It is so heavy he almost got internal rupture but in the end he managed to throw in the rail. Nothing happens. Man is sitting down. He is totally broken... Something happens! 

There was a goat grazing nearby. The goat is jumping higher than a kangaroo. The animal is jumping towards the pit and eventually does a flip right into the hole. The guy is shocked. 

""What? No. No! There's no way that goats can do such things!"" He's thinking intensely. 

""What the hell just happened?!""

 Someone is taping him on the back. The guy turns around. He sees another man that is wearing eared cap. He's looking strange. Perhaps he's a villager.

\- Eyyyy! There was my goat here!

\- Yes there was.

\- Eyyy! And where is the goat?! What have you done to her!?

\- I did nothing to the goat. It was grazing here.

\- EEee! It was! And where is it now?!

\- Mister... it's strange. Oh! Maybe you can help me to solve this riddle! There is a big hole here. Your goat was grazing right here and suddenly it jumped a few times and then it did a flip right into the pit.

\- EEEEE! WHAT?! Into that hole?! It's not f\*\*\*\*ing possible!

\- How so?

\- Eyyy! It couldn't jump into that hole because it was attached by rope to a train rail.",Jokes

Does anyone else remember this joke?," Years ago I heard this joke from a friend and I've been trying to find it online ever since.

The  basic template of the joke is that a busload of tourists are traveling through the mountains. The bus blows a tire and the passengers disembark. A Samurai appears from nowhere and kills half the passengers then flees into the night. This happens again several times at subsequent stops until  everyone apart from the driver is dead. Suddenly spotting the samurai in the distance the driver challenges him and asks ""Did you kill all those  people?"" 

The Samurai replies with a flat ""No"".

There was a porta-potty near the edge of a small cliff,"Everyday young Bobby would walk by it on the way home from school, and every day he would resist the temptation to kick it off the edge of the cliff.

This all changed one day when Bobby had a particularly bad day at school. He had learned about boring topics, like how George Washington cut down a cherry tree and wasn't punished because he was honest, and Bobby had also failed a math test. He was heading to his friend's house, and since he was in a bad mood, he decided he would actually kick the porta-potty down the cliff this time. He gave it a solid kick and saw it tumble end over end down the cliff until it finally reached a stop at the bottom. Bobby now felt satisfied and continued on his way to his friend's house.

Bobby had a great time at his friend's house but then had to go home. However, when he got home his father was in a particularly bad mood. 

His father asked Bobby if he knew why the porta-potty was at the bottom of the cliff.

Bobby was very nervous and wanted to lie, but he thought about George Washington and the cherry tree and decided he should come clean. 

Bobby told his father: ""It was me, dad. I won't lie to you. I kicked the porta-potty down the cliff because I was in a bad mood.""

So it came as a shock to Bobby when his father suddenly grabbed him and spanked him.

Bobby, now in tears because of the pain, said: ""Why dad? Why did you hurt me, George Washington's dad didn't punish him when he cut down the cherry tree.""

The father looked Bobby dead in the eyes and said ""That's because George Washington's father wasn't in the cherry tree""",Jokes

On the third tee, the husband said, “Honey be very careful when you drive the ball. Don’t knock out any windows, it will cost a fortune to fix.”

The wife teed off and shanked it right through the window off the biggest house on the course.

The husband cringed and said, “I told you to watch out for the houses. Lets go apologize, and see how much this is going to cost.”

They walked up, knocked on the door, and heard a voice say, “Come in.”

They opened the door and saw glass all over the floor and broken bottle lying on its side in the foyer. A man sitting on the couch said, “Are you the people that broke that window?”

“Yes, sorry about that,” the husband replied.

“No actually I want to thank you. I’m a genie that was trapped for a thousand years in that bottle. You released me. I’m allowed to grant three wishes. I’ll give you each one wish and keep one for myself.”

“OK, great!” the husband said. “I want a million dollars a year for life.”

“No problem, its the least I could do. And you, what do you want?” the genie said, looking at the wife.

“I want a house in every country in the world,” said the wife.

“Consider it done,” the genie replied.

“And what is your wish, genie?” the husband asked.

“Well since I have been trapped in that bottle, I haven’t had sex with a woman in a thousand years. My wish is to sleep with your wife.”

The husband looked at the wife and said, “Well we did get a lot of money, and all those houses, honey. I guess I don’t care.” It was OK with the wife too.

The genie took the wife upstairs and ravished her for two hours. After it was over the, the genie rolled over, looked at the wife and asked, “How old are you and your husband?”

“He’s 35 and I’m 33,” she replied.

How many lawyers does it take to change a lightbulb?,"Such number as may be deemed to perform the stated task in a timely and efficient manner within the strictures of the following agreement:

Whereas the party of the first part, also known as “Lawyer,” and the party of the second part, also known as “Light Bulb,” do hereby and forthwith agree to a transaction wherein the party of the second part (Light Bulb) shall be removed from the current position as a result of failure to perform previously agreed-upon duties, i.e., the illumination of the area ranging from the front (north) door, through the entryway, terminating at an area just inside the primary living area, demarcated by the beginning of the carpet, any spillover illumination being at the option of the party of the second part (Light Bulb) and not required by the aforementioned agreement between the parties.

The aforementioned removal transaction shall include, but not be limited to, the following steps:

1.) The party of the first part (Lawyer) shall, with or without elevation, at his option, by means of a chair, step-stool, ladder, or any other means of elevation, grasp the party of the second part (Light Bulb) and rotate the party of the second part (Light Bulb) in a counterclockwise direction, said direction being non- negotiable. Said grasping and rotation of the party of the second part (Light Bulb) shall be undertaken by the party of the first part (Lawyer) with every reasonable caution by the party of the first part (Lawyer) to maintain the structural integrity of the party of the second part (Light Bulb), notwithstanding the aforementioned failure of the party of the second part (Light Bulb) to perform the aforementioned customary and agreed-upon duties. The foregoing notwithstanding, however, both parties stipulate that structural failure of the party of the second part (Light Bulb) may be incidental to the aforementioned failure to perform, and in such case the party of the first part (Lawyer) shall be held blameless for such structural failure insofar as this agreement is concerned so long as the non-negotiable directional codicil (counterclockwise) is observed by the party of the first part (Lawyer) throughout.

2.) Upon reaching a point where the party of the second part (Light Bulb) becomes separated from the party of the third part (“Receptacle”), the party of the first part (Lawyer) shall have the option of disposing of the party of the second part (Light Bulb) in a manner consistent with all applicable state, local, and federal statutes.

3.) Once separation and disposal have been achieved, the party of the first part (Lawyer) shall have the option of beginning installation of the party of the fourth part (“New Light Bulb”). This installation shall occur in a manner consistent with the reverse of the procedures described in Step 1 of this document, being careful to note that the rotation should occur in a clockwise direction, said direction also being non-negotiable.

NOTE: The above-described steps may be performed, at the option of the party of the first part (Lawyer), by said party of the first part (Lawyer), by his heirs and assigns, or by any and all persons authorized by him to do so, the objective being to produce a level of illumination in the immediate vicinity of the aforementioned front (north) door consistent with maximization of commerce and revenue for the party of the fifth part, also known as “The Firm.”",Jokes

A rabbit hops into a pub..,"A rabbit walks into a pub and says to the barman:

‘Can I have a pint of beer, and a Ham and Cheese Toastie?’

The barman is amazed, but gives the rabbit a pint of beer and a ham  and cheese toastie. The rabbit drinks the beer and eats the toastie. He then leaves.

The following night the rabbit returns and again asks for a pint of beer, and a Ham and Cheese Toastie. The barman, now intrigued by the rabbit and the extra drinkers in the pub, (because word gets round), gives the rabbit the pint and the
toastie. The rabbit consumes them and leaves.

The next night, the pub is packed. In walks the rabbit and says, ‘A pint of beer and a Ham and Cheese Toastie, please barman.’
The crowd is hushed as the barman gives the rabbit his pint and toastie, and then burst into applause as the rabbit wolfs them down.

The next night there is standing room only in the pub. Coaches have been laid on for the crowds of patrons attending. The barman is making more money in one week than he did all last year. In walks the rabbit and says, ‘A pint of beer and a Ham and Cheese Toastie, please barman’.

The barman says, ‘I’m sorry rabbit, old mate, old mucker, but we are right out of them Ham and Cheese Toasties..’.

The rabbit looks aghast. The crowd has quietened to almost a whisper, when the barman clears his throat nervously and says, ‘We do have a very nice Cheese and Onion Toastie.’ The rabbit looks him in the eye and says, ‘Are you sure I will like it?’

The masses’ bated breath is ear shatteringly silent.
The barman, with a roguish smile says, ‘Do you think that I would let down one of my best friends. I know you’ll
love it.’
‘Ok’, says the rabbit, ‘I’ll have a pint of beer and a Cheese and Onion Toastie.’

The pub erupts with glee as the rabbit quaffs the beer and guzzles the toastie. He then waves to the crowd and leaves….

..NEVER TO RETURN!!!!!!

One year later, in the now impoverished public house, the barman, (who has only served 4 drinks tonight, 3 of which were his), calls time. When he is cleaning down the now empty bar, he sees a small white form, floating above the bar.

The barman says, ‘Who are you?’, to which he is answered, ‘I am the ghost of the rabbit that used to frequent your public house.’

The barman says, ‘I remember you. You made me famous. You would come in every night and have a pint of beer and a Ham and Cheese Toastie. Masses came to see you and this place was famous.’

The rabbit says, ‘Yes I know.’

The barman said, ‘I remember, on your last night we didn’t have any Ham and Cheese Toasties. You had a Cheese and Onion one instead.’

The rabbit said, ‘Yes, you promised me that I would love it.’

The barman said, ‘You never came back, what happened?’

If the Great War was a bar fight,"Germany, Austria and Italy are standing together in the middle of a pub when Serbia bumps into Austria and spills Austria's pint. Austria demands Serbia buy it a complete new suit because there are splashes on its trouser leg. Germany expresses its support for Austria's point of view. Britain recommends that everyone calm down a bit. Serbia points out that it can't afford a whole suit, but offers to pay for the cleaning of Austria's trousers. Russia and Serbia look at Austria. Austria asks Serbia who it's looking at. Russia suggests that Austria should leave its little brother alone. Austria inquires as to whose army will assist Russia in compelling it to do so. 

Germany complains to Britain that France has been staring at it, and that this is sufficiently out of order that Britain should not intervene. Britain replies that France can look at who it wants to, that Britain is looking at Germany too, and what is Germany going to do about it? Germany tells Russia to stop staring at Austria, or Germany will render Russia incapable of such action. Britain and France ask Germany whether it's eying Belgium.

Turkey and Germany go off into a corner and whisper. When they come back, Turkey makes a show of not looking at anyone. Germany rolls up its sleeves, looks at France, and punches Belgium. France and Britain punch Germany. Austria punches Russia. Germany punches Britain and France with one hand and Russia with the other. Russia throws a punch at Germany, but misses and nearly falls over. Japan calls over from the other side of the room that it's on Britain's side, but stays there. Italy surprises everyone by punching Austria. Australia punches Turkey and gets punched back. There are no hard feelings because Britain made Australia do it. France gets thrown through a plate-glass window, but gets back up and carries on fighting. Russia gets thrown through another one, gets knocked out, suffers brain damage, and wakes up with a complete personality change. Italy throws a punch at Austria and misses, but Austria falls over anyway. Italy raises both fists in the air and runs round the room chanting. 

America waits till Germany is about to fall over from sustained punching from Britain and France, then walks over and smashes it with a barstool, then pretends it won the fight all by itself. By now all the chairs are broken and the big mirror over the bar is shattered. Britain, France, and America agree that Germany threw the first punch, so the whole thing is Germany's fault. While Germany is still unconscious, they go through its pockets, steal its wallet, and buy drinks for all their friends.",Jokes

A rich but also stingy father was trying to put together a grand celebration for his daughters birthday!,"A wealthy, but stingy father was trying to put a birthday party together for his 18 y/o daughter.

He wanted the party to be extravagant, but wanted to spend as little money as possible. He had finished all of the other decorations, and he was left to work on the cake.

""Why not get it ordered from an upscale bakery?"" his wife said.

So the father visited a ton of different bakeries and did research, but found the prices to be too high.

*My daughter is inviting all of her friends, and I'll look bad if I don't put together a good cake*, he thought. Then, he stumbled upon a shop that opened once a year to provide free cake to its customers.

*How quaint,* the father thought, but desperate, he walked inside to see if they could provide a cake for his daughter's birthday.

He was met by a Buddhist monk chanting and lighting incense.

""Hello,"" the father asked, ""I would like to buy a cake.""

""Of course,"" the monk replied, ""just draw a picture of the cake you would like on the notepad on the desk.""

The father thought this to be weird, but wanting to save as much money as possible, he gave him the address and told him to come in the backdoor, just in case the cake was bad.

The day of the party arrived and the monk visited the house with the most extravagant cake the family had ever seen. All of the guests were in awe, and whispered to each other about how much the cake could have cost.

The monk became the guest of honor and at the end of the party, the father approached the monk and asked,

""Why do you do this for free? You should take money for your services!""

The monk smiled and said, ""I do this for free because a cake day is the best way to earn karma.""",Jokes

Luisa died in a car accident,"
Luisa died in a car accident and as she was approaching the pearly gates, an angel stops her and says, 


“ you have lived a good life, but due to the high volumes of deaths lately, we decide that we will give the people a choice when they die, if they’d rather go to heaven or hell”

Louisa exclaimed “no! I’ve already made up my mind I want to go to heaven”

The angel recommends that she spend one day in heaven and one in hell and then make her final decision and so she agrees. 

Upon Louisa’s request, she spent the first day in heaven: it was beautiful and unlike anything she had ever imagine, the landscape, the clouds and the angels playing harps, etc.

On the second day, she was sent to hell and to her surprise, there she saw her friends sitting at a huge table drinking and smoking with a barbecue going on in the background. They welcomed her to the table to catch up on some gossiping and the devil was there, cracking jokes and laughing with them. They partied all day and had a good sleep.

Before Louisa knew it, the second day was up and so the angel called her up and told her to choose wisely as she only gets one chance. Louisa is surprised and can’t believe her decision but she decides that she wants to stay in hell. 

So the angel bid farewell to her and with a snap of his fingers, Louisa was back in hell. But everything was different this time: she saw all her friends in rags picking up trash and being whipped by demons and being tortured with flames. She started to panic and then she felt the hand of the devil around her.

She tremblingly asked him “what’s going on here” to which he replied:

Blind pilots on a vacation flight,"English is not my first language but I'll try! It worked on my language :)

The plane was parked and everyone was ready - a big plane and tons of people in line walking up the back staircase. Suddenly one of the passengers see from a distance what appears to be two blind members of the crew walking with a white cane, being guided by others flight attendants towards the front staircase.

""Who are those two?"" asked the passenger to the flight attendant welcoming them on board.

""Those are our pilots!"" she proudly replied

""But.. but..."" 

""Yeah! Don't worry, they are our new professional trained pilots.. and they were hired because of the quota. Our company requires a certain percentage of people with disability. So here they are! Don't worry, they have experience!""

It was already late... the rumor was quickly out. Everyone on board of the plane was already worried, some of them were praying, some of the were writing messages, nail biting... then the pilot:

""Ladies and gentlemen, welcome onboard. We are ready to take-off. Enjoy your flight""

The plane slowly starts to gain speed... and everyone is super apprehensive, even more than before. More speed.. more speed... and no signal to take off. The passengers then realize something could be wrong, some are crying, kids are screaming. More speed and no signal of taking off.. the runway was almost in the end when everybody screams at the same time...

""AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH"" 

Then slowly the plain starts to take off.. calmly, like nothing.. by the book. Already in the air, the pilot then talks to the co-pilot: 

""Another successful take-off! Well done to us!!""

Then the copilot a bit sarcastic replies: 

""Yes! But I don't want to know what is going to happen when they don't scream!""",Jokes

The Mysterious Letters of Gustavo Rahre,"Gustavo Rahre (1932-1991) was an eccentric Chilean artist who left mysterious sculptures of letters of the alphabet scattered in remote locations around the globe. Working with local materials—limestone, sandstone, granite, clay, even wood and peat—he sculpted his first letter, an O, not far from his alma mater in Santiago, in 1960. 

After that, he began traveling the world, crisscrossing the globe several times, leaving sculptures—some only a few feet tall, some towering twenty feet above the ground and weighing several tons—in countries around the world, primarily in the Americas, Europe and Australia. 

The artist apparently had no patronage. The project was a purely personal obsession, and he informed no one of his work, leaving the letters for others to discover. Moreover, apart from one upper-case L that still stands in New Mexico, he sculpted only the vowels. Taking many months for each piece, he carved, A, E, I, O, U, and sometimes, Y. By the time of his death in March 1991 he had created 43 known pieces.

For nearly 30 years the sculptures remained as the sculptor had left them. However, because they were unprotected from the elements and not in the care of any museum or university, the elements took their toll and the carvings began to weaken. After three of them toppled over and shattered, Santiago University decided to try to preserve the remaining works. The university’s art department hired sculpture restoration expert Dr. Michaelangelo Rodin to visit each of the remaining forty letters and take any necessary steps to restore and protect them. 

Rodin spent the next ten summers doing just that. In most cases, he found the primary problem was a weakening of the upright letters’ base. Either the ground was eroding away, or the actual base of the sculpture was deteriorating, leaving the sculpture in danger of collapse. The best solution, he determined, was to cut the sculpture off of its base and tip it over, lowering it gently to the ground with the help of local crews recruited for the task. There it could remain on its original site, but horizontal and fully supported. 

He made many trips from Santiago to locations around the world. The longest single journey was to the small town of Nenagh, Ireland, where he then drove 28 miles into the countryside. The lower-case E there, sculpted in 1974, was loose and poorly supported by the soft ground. With the help of six hearty Irishmen, Rodin was able to ease it into the horizontal position without further damage. The one-way mileage on that trip was nearly 3,300. 

When Rodin was through he had successfully restored and preserved 36 of the 40 statues. He was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize in the Letters category and while he did not win, the chairman of that year’s selection committee said it had been a very difficult decision. 

“Unfortunately for Professor Rodin, we had another nominee that the panel thought was just slightly more deserving,” the chairman said. “However, his accomplishment in preserving these unique works of art is certainly impressive and praiseworthy.

“And 3,300 miles,” he added. “It’s a long way to tip a Rahre E.”",Jokes

Finally, the policeman loses his temper and demands his real name, or he’ll shoot the boy. 

“Buttitches!” the boy declares stubbornly. So the policeman takes out his gun and kills him. 

The boy mother comes in at that point and loses her mind, screaming and wailing.

'Wait!' A lady shouts out at the front row, 'Why the joke always begins with a man? why can it be a woman who walks into a bar? we're all equal!'

'But if it begins with a woman walks into a bar, it won't be funny..'

'Are you saying women aren't funny? That's discrimination! If you replace man with women the joke is still funny! I'll telling you that!'

'But ma'am, you don't know what joke I'm about to tell!'

'It doesn't matter! I don't care what you're telling I'm sure any joke can be funny with a woman instead of a man! Just do it!'

'Well...' the comedian thinks for a while and says: 'I thought about the joke I'm about to tell, and I have to say you might be right!'

So here is the joke the comedian was about to tell:

A man walks into a bar with a bag and orders a drink.

After awhile, the bartender asks him, “What is in the bag?”

The man says, “Nothing, don’t worry about it”

The night continues and the bartender keeps asking but the man keeps giving him the same answer.

Towards the end of the night the bartender offers the man a free beer if the man shows him what is in the bag.

The man agrees.

He reaches into the bag and pulls out a tiny piano and a tiny man that sits down and starts playing the piano.

The bartender says, “Wow! That’s amazing! Where did you find they guy?”

The man looks up and says, “I have this magic lamp that grants me wishes, but the stupid thing is broken.”

The man then hands the bartender the lamp and says, “You can try it if you want.”

The bartender happily grabs the lamp and wishes for a million bucks and the room is suddenly filled with a million ducks.

“This thing is definitely broken!” says the bartender.

The man replies, “Tell me about it, do you really think I wished for a twelve inch pianist?”",Jokes

Night out at the Pick-up bar,"Yes I’m getting on in the years myself, but I still like women a few years older than me. Anyhow last Saturday evening I wen out to one of the local spots. It was pretty quite for a Saturday night but there was a Hen party (female version of a Stag party. Sometimes called a Doe party) which pretty much had run of the dance floor.  The only other patron was a statuesque redhead, probably around late fifties who was dressed to the nines.  She caught my eye and raised her glass to me, I replied in kind then shuffled down the bar to join her.
She commented on the girls of the hen party, and I said let them have their fun. It’ll be something to remember when they hit our age. She agreed and we started Idle chatter about being then”older generation”. And the foolish things we’d done when we were younger, what it was like to give up freedom to have a family and raise kids, regrets of life of things we’d done and regrets of things we didn’t do.
After a few drinks we started talking about our sexual exploits, things we’d done with various partners, places we made out you know the type of thing. At a natural pause in the conversation, she looked over her glas and asked me if I’d ever had a threesome. 
Well yes I have on several occasions.
She then asked if I’d ever had a mother/daughter threesome
That was a definite no. I’d had one with sisters, but never a Mother Daughter  threesome.
She then look me square in the eye and said This could be your lucky evening.
Well we finished up our drinks and walked back to our place in each other arms chattering and staggering a bit. We get to her place and she opens the door and calls upstairs.

Two morticians alternated in sharing the responsibility of covering the night shift.," One early morning about 3:00 am, a body was brought into the
mortuary, and the mortician began work. When he had unclothed the corpse,
he noticed a cork in the anus. Removing it, the strains of ""Hello, Dolly,
well, hello, Dolly...!"" were plainly heard being sung. He put the cork
back, and the singing stopped. Pulling it out again, the same song
started, ""You're lookin' swell, Dolly!"".

Amazed, he telephoned his partner, and insisted he come immediately to see
something very unusual. Roused from sleep, the partner asked if it could
wait till morning. But he was persistent, and finally the partner agreed
to dress and come down to the shop.

When he got there, he said, ""Now what was it that was so important you had
to get me out of bed at this ungodly hour?"" The partner said, ""Come into
the embalming room.""

They go into the embalming room, and the first partner says, ""Now watch.""
He pulls out the cork, and the anus takes off singing again. The partner
looks at him disgustedly and says:

A new guy starts work at a bakery.,"He's handed his rota and his eyes lighten up: ""Great, it's dinner-roll day!"". The supervisor is puzzled to see such enthusiasm for so mundane a task as baking dinner rolls, but sure enough, the new guy goes to it with zest and panache and is soon turning out dinner rolls the like of which the supervisor has never seen or tasted, imaginatively designed and with a taste and texture beyond all praise or even description.

&amp;#x200B;

It's the same again the next day when the new guy comes in and looks at the rota: ""Wow, wholemeal loaf day!"".

On Wednesday he takes one look at the words ""Danish Pastry day"" on the rota and immediately bursts into song, turning out tray after tray of beautifully formed and succulent Danish pastries, and on Thursday the excited shriek of ""Doughnut day!

Finally, the week after that he inquired about an even more intense program and was offered a 30 pounds per week weight loss program. This time instead of his trainer being a gorgeous girl, it was a buff guy wearing nothing but a G-string and a tank top saying ""If I catch you, you're mine"".

The tale of the bear and the rabbit,"A bear and a rabbit is sitting next to each other in the woods, taking a shit when the bear asks the rabbit.  “Do you mind when you get shit stuck in your fur? “No.” says the rabbit. The bear then proceeds to wipe his ass with the rabbit.

A few weeks later, as both walk together they stumble upon a lamp, lying under a large birch tree. “Oh look! Maybe it’s a magical lamp” says the bear as he picks the lamp up and rubs it with his large paws. There is a big puff of smoke and suddenly, a genie appears from the smoke, coughing a bit, “Whoaa, you awoke my slumber, and now I have to grant you three wishes each, \*yaaaawn\*”. “I should definitely go first, since I found it” the bear proudly states. “Sure, whatever”. “I want all the bears in this forest, except me, to be female. Oooooh looooord I’m gonna get so much pussey”. The genie waves hands and says that his wish has come true. “I would like a motorcycle.” says the rabbit. “Pfft, what a fucking idiot” acclaim the bear. But the genie does the same waving of the hands, and a motorcycle appears with a puff of smoke. Now the bear goes again, “I want all the bears, except me, in this COUNTRY to be female, DAAAAAMN I’m gonna get so much pussey!”. Once again, the genie waves his hands and it’s done. The rabbit this time asks for a motorcycle helmet, as the bear just shakes his head. As well as the previous wish, it is granted and he stands with a helmet in his hands. The bear is bouncing up and down at this point, “I-i-i-i, I want all the bears, except me, in THE WHOLE WORLD to be female, OH MY GOOOOD I’m gonna get so much pusseeeey!!!”. “You know you could’ve asked that the first time?” says the rabbit. “Whatever, at least I didn’t ask for a stupid motorcycle and a weird helmet”. The genie waves his hands and says that all the bears in the world, except him, are now female. The rabbit proceeds to mount his new shining motorcycle, adjusts his helmet, and says, “I wish the fucking bear is gay.”, and accelerates into the distance flipping the bear off.",Jokes

The wrestling match was about to begin...,"...and the Contender's coach was once again lecturing the Contender.

""If I've told you once, I've told you a thousand times-don't let the Champion get you in The Pretzel! No one has ever been able to get out of The Pretzel!""

The Contender nodded his head, getting ready for the match. ""I know, Coach, if you've told me once...I won't let him get me in The Pretzel!""

""Good! Just don't let him get you in The Pretzel!""

""Coach!""

The crowd in the arena was roaring. The two wrestlers moved to ring, a well lit white square in the center of the seats. The Contender was called and the crowd cheered, then the Champion was called and the crowd roared.

Coach called to the Contender ""Don't let him get you in The Pretzel!"", and the Contender nodded and moved into the center. After a few moments, the match began. 

Coach watched as the wrestlers twisted together, all power and speed. The crowd surged. The bodies on the mat became a twisted wreck.

""The Pretzel..."" the Coach whispered, reaching to throw the towel into the ring, knowing there was no way the Contender could win. Before he could, though, there was a horrible, wrenching scream of agony from the ring. The wrestlers parted, fought, and before anyone could react, the Contender had the Championed pinned. The count went down.

There was a new Champion.

Coach's jaw was on the ground, the towel still in his hand. He was amazed, shocked.

The new Champion was hustled into the locker room, and Coach followed.

""How did you do that? No one has ever got out of The Pretzel! Never!""

""Well, Coach, if you've told me once, you've told me a thousand times...but he is really good. I thought I had everything under control, but he was so fast, before I knew it, he had me in The Pretzel and I heard the count going down. I couldn't move.""

"A man was eating a bright, red apple.","It was on a warm, sunny day that the most peculiar of things occurred. A man, was happily snacking on a bright, red apple when, too lazy to walk to a trash can, he threw it out the window. A seemingly non-problematic apple would have been ignored under any other circumstances, but the man lived on the 50th story of a building and so as the apple fell, it became all but lethal. Luckily, the apple softened its fall by hitting the head of a pedestrian who in turn fell into the street. A nearby car swerved in a panic, hitting a pole. 

Emergency services were quickly called to respond to the scene and an ambulance was sent. A nearby bird spotted the remains of the apple, and it swooped in just as the ambulance arrived getting hit by the windshield of the vehicle. The driver, vision obscured by the bird, drove blindly down the road going over a railing. The resulting impact with the ground knocked a tire from the vehicle up into the air and onto a nearby slope. 

The tire picked up velocity and started going down a sloped road. 

Police, on response to a criminal threat, attempted to fire at a criminal just as the tire hit, sending the bullet wildly off-course hitting the pilot of a plane just taking off. 

The man who started all this, oblivious as he was then, had arrived at a medical check-up that he was due for, later that day. Just as he was about to meet his doctor, the plane crashed into the doctor, killing him instantly.

Poetry in motion,"As a science teacher my students will sometimes ask me why it is I have them read poetry in class.. I tell them that poetry like science, seeks to observe and explain the universe. Rather than with experiments and data it does so with the thoughts and words of the author. There is much we can learn about science from the great poets.  For example, I have recently been reading Walt Whitman and comparing him to Robert Frost. Both write about one of my favorite subjects, nature. I also know a little bit about their writing habits. Frost would go for long walks after which he would write a line or two. After the following day's walk, he would add to the poem.  In this way his poems were built piece by piece. Whitman would write over a longer period. His poetry style therefore is more fluid and flowing. When you examine Frost's poems you can almost sense where one walk ended and another walk began. You get no such sense from Whitman. The differences are so apparent even if you did not know who wrote a passage you could identify the author by the writing style. My students looked at me after I revealed this information. Tell us, what is the significance of this? They asked. I replied, it's simple. He who hesitates is Frost!",Jokes

Old Mary and Frank have been having some matrimonial issues...,"No matter how hard he tries, Frank just can't bring Mary to orgasm anymore. 

They decide to visit the doctor for help, because they love each other, in all the ways, and this lack of intimacy is bringing them both down emotionally. 

Thankfully the doctor has the answer. He advises Frank to get a strapping young buck of a man to come over one evening and assist in the love making. All this young man needs to do is stand by the side of the bed as Frank and Mary get down to business, and wave a bathroom towel over them. Guaranteed orgasm from Mary the doctor promises. 

So the next night Frank nervously asks one of his young attractive male work colleagues for a favour. 

'Hey Greg, Can you come over and watch me and my wife have sex? You don't have to get involved, just wave a towel over us as we get jiggy. Then you can go home. I'll give you $200'

Greg agrees. 200 dollars is 200 dollars. He arrives at Frank's house that evening and as the lovemaking commences he gently wafts a towel over the copulating geriatrics. 

No dice though. Mary still can't orgasm. Dejected, Frank and Mary visit the doctor again the next day. 

'It didn't make a difference Doc... I was doing all my best tricks and we had Greg there waving the towel over us but still my poor Mary can't orgasm'.

The doctor thinks for a second then replies 'ok.. we can try one more thing. Get Greg over again tonight. But this time, have Greg make love to Mary while you stand at the side of the bed and wave the bathroom towel over them. See how that goes'. 

And so it was done. Mary lays back in bed, Greg agrees to come over again, $200 is $200 after all, gets into bed with Mary and starts to make love to her while Frank stands at the side of the bed waving the towel over them with all he's got 

Well. Mary had orgasm over orgasm. She couldn't stop herself. She was going all night long and has the best 8 hours of her life. 

Completely spent, Mary flops back her pillow with the biggest grin on her face that Frank has ever seen. Mission accomplished.

If WWI was a bar fight," 

&gt;*Germany, Austria and Italy are standing together in the middle of a pub when Serbia bumps into Austria and spills Austria's pint. Austria demands Serbia buy it a complete new suit because there are splashes on its trouser leg. Germany expresses its support for Austria's point of view. Britain recommends that everyone calm down a bit.*  
*Serbia points out that it can't afford a whole suit, but offers to pay for the cleaning of Austria's trousers. Russia and Serbia look at Austria. Austria asks Serbia who it's looking at. Russia suggests that Austria should leave its little brother alone. Austria inquires as to whose army will assist Russia in compelling it to do so. Germany appeals to Britain that France has been looking at it, and that this is sufficiently out of order that Britain should not intervene. Britain replies that France can look at who it wants to, that Britain is looking at Germany too, and what is Germany going to do about it?*  
*Germany tells Russia to stop looking at Austria, or Germany will render Russia incapable of such action. Britain and France ask Germany whether it's looking at Belgium. Turkey and Germany go off into a corner and whisper.*  
*When they come back, Turkey makes a show of not looking at anyone. Germany rolls up its sleeves, looks at France, and punches Belgium. France and Britain punch Germany. Austria punches Russia. Germany punches Britain and France with one hand and Russia with the other. Russia throws a punch at Germany, but misses and nearly falls over. Japan calls over from the other side of the room that it's on Britain's side, but stays there. Italy surprises everyone by punching Austria.*  
*~~Austria~~* *Australia punches Turkey, and gets punched back. There are no hard feelings because Britain made* *~~Austria~~* *Australia do it. France gets thrown through a plate glass window, but gets back up and carries on fighting. Russia gets thrown through another one, gets knocked out, suffers brain damage, and wakes up with a complete personality change. Italy throws a punch at Austria and misses, but Austria falls over anyway.*  
*Italy raises both fists in the air and runs round the room chanting. America waits till Germany is about to fall over from sustained punching from Britain and France, then walks over and smashes it with a barstool, then pretends it won the fight all by itself. By now all the chairs are broken and the big mirror over the bar is shattered. Britain, France and America agree that Germany threw the first punch, so the whole thing is Germany's fault. While Germany is still unconscious, they go through its pockets, steal its wallet, and buy drinks for all their friends.*",Jokes

""You see the problem?"" the toad said. ""All my life I've been like this. I want to be green, like the other toads.""
The wizard nodded gravely, took out a magic wand and waved it above the toad. At once, the toad became a smooth, lovely green color. The toad hopped with joy, thanking the wizard profusely, until he noticed that the spell had not entirely worked. His penis was still yellow.
""What do I do about this?"" the toad asked. ""I can't go around this way.""
The wizard apologized, saying, ""I can only work one spell each day, I'm afraid. But in the next forest over, you'll find another wizard who can complete the spell."" The toad thanked the wizard and hopped off.
A short while later, a bear came to the wizard's door. When the wizard opened it, he saw that the bear was entirely blue in color.
""Can you help me?"" asked the bear.
The wizard shrugged and said, ""I'm out of magic for the day, I'm afraid. But there is another wizard in the next forest.""
""How do I get there?"" asked the bear.

"Quincy inherited a large sum of money at a young age from his father, but he wasted it all on illicit drugs and became destitute and homeless.","It's a cold December night in New York City, with temperatures well below freezing point. Quincy shivers in his one and only winter coat, the same one he's had for the past ten years, lying on a park bench sheltered by nothing but tree canopies. Quincy, in a rare moment of soberness and self-reflection, begins to ponder how his existence had descended to this point.

He recalls the elaborate lifestyle he enjoyed as a child. That memory seems to distant now... Quincy lost his mother when he was 4, and his father single-handedly brought him up through the teenager years. His father was a successful investor and hedge fund manager; that's what he loved doing. ""God, if my father knew what has become of me,"" thinks Quincy, ""he would be furious."" Suddenly, an idea comes into Quincy's mind: ""If investing is what my father did to get rich, why can't I do the same?"" Filled with sudden determination, Quincy spends the rest of the night devising an action plan to turn his life around, and to make his father proud.

The next day, Quincy sets out to look for minimum-wage jobs. Although many places reject him, he eventually lands a job as a fast-food worker. He works diligently and is soon promoted to manager. He spends all of his time reading books on the financial system, personal finance, psychology, and investing. After two years of rigorous self-education, he feels ready to finally to enter the world of investing. He lands an apprenticeship with the same investing firm that employed his father. The CEO of the firm is very impressed with Quincy's ability to withstand market volatility, and appoints him to manage a mutual fund that focuses on small-cap growth stocks. ""I have finally made my father proud,"" says Quincy to himself.

Having achieved the life goal he has set for himself, Quincy begins to get his guard down. He begins to relapse into using the same drugs that led to his initial downfall. He starts to show up to work high, and even starts offering his colleagues some of his ""finest"" powder. When the CEO learns that Quincy has become a drug freak that tries to get everyone else high too, he tells Quincy to meet him in his office.

""You wanted to see me?"" asks Quincy.

""Yes,"" the CEO replies, ""I cannot allow you to continue to work here, I'm afraid. You have committed one of the most serious violations of our company policy.""

Quincy shifts nervously in his seat, he knows what is coming. ""What... What have I done?""

The CEO sighs, ""We strictly prohibit high-freak-Quincy trading.""",Jokes

Now, being partially deaf, the little old lady did not hear “fairy cottage”, but instead “hairy bottom!” And though she questioned their choice she was polite enough not to decline.

A week later the little old lady decided to buy herself a dog. Yet again, despite last time, she asked her neighbours what she should call it, and they said “billy.”

Now, I’m sure you can guess what she thought they said: “willy”
So again, though confused, she called her little dog willy.

A month passed, and the old ladies dog went missing. She flew into a terrible panic and after hours of searching she decided to ask in town.

So the little old lady came running into town screaming at the top of her lungs:
“HELP, HELP, I’ve looked all over my hairy bottom but I just can’t find my willy!”",Jokes

I accompanied my father to a funeral..,"When I was about 9 years old, I accompanied my father to the funeral of a friend of his, someone who I didn't even know.  
When we got there, I stayed in a corner waiting for the time to pass. Then a man approached me and said, 'Enjoy life kid, be happy because time flies. Look at me now, I didn't enjoy it'. Then he passed his over my head and left.  
My father, before leaving, forced me to say goodbye to the dead person. When I looked in the coffin, I was horrified to see that man in the coffin was the same man who had spoken to me!

My Dear Janie,

You will surely understand that I have certain needs that you, being 57 years old, can no longer satisfy. I am very happy with you and I value you as a good wife. Therefore, after reading this letter, I hope that you will not wrongly interpret the fact that I will be spending the evening with my 18 year old secretary at the Comfort Inn Hotel.

My ""Dearest Husband"" ,

I received your letter and thank you for your honesty about my being 57 years old. I would like to take this opportunity to  remind you that you are also 57 years old. 

As a math teacher at our local college. I would like to inform you that while you read this, I will be at the Hotel Fiesta with Michael, one of my students, who is also the assistant tennis coach. He is young, virile, and like your secretary, is 18 years old.

As a successful lawyer who has an excellent knowledge of math, you will understand that we are in the same situation, although with one small difference - 18 goes into 57 a lot more times than 57 goes into 18.

A depressed man walks into a bar (it's long but you won't regret reading it),"A depressed man walks into a bar. Not just any bar though, this bar is located on the 110th floor of a skyscraper. The depressed man, dragging his head, sits down and with a slight sob in his voice and asks the bar tender for his cheapest whiskey.

A tall, somewhat nerdy looking gentleman sitting nearby notices the depressed man, ""Hey buddy, what's bothering you?""

The depressed man looks deep into his glass, shaking slightly, ""My wife left me for my best friend. She took everything, the house, my kids, my money and even my dog. I have nothing left.""

The gentleman smirks, ""Well hey, it's never too late to turn things around.""

The depressed man turns with empty bloodshot eyes, in a harsh tone, ""What do you know of it, pretty boy?! It's easy to say that shit when you're so well off!""

The gentleman slaps his knee, ""Hah! Just three months ago I was right where you're sitting! There is a secret in this bar though, one that can change everything!""

Skeptical, the depressed man scoffed, ""Yeah, right. Sure...""

The gentleman stands up sharply and gestures to a window behind him, ""This here is a magical window. If you leap from it and make a wish on the way down, you will instantly pop back into this room and your wish will be granted!""

The depressed man drinks from his cheap whiskey and pretends to ignore the clearly insane ramblings.

Grinning, the gentleman walks to the window and opens it, ""Don't believe me? Fine, I'll prove it to you."" The gentleman begins to step out of the window…

In a state of shock, the depressed man stumbles to try and pull the lunatic from the open window, but he is too late! In a thundering clap, the entire bar shakes as a gust of wind rips through, clashing glasses and knocking over stools. To the depressed man's disbelief, the gentleman was back in the room standing near the pool tables!

In awe, the depressed man stutters, ""H...how...wh...what did you wish for?!""

With a proud look, the gentleman announced, ""I wished for superhuman strength!"" As he spoke, he grasped the side of the nearby pool table and lifted it high into the air with a single hand!

The depressed man still in shock looked back at the magic window, ""S...so all I need to do is c...climb out that window and make a wish?""

The gentleman nodded. Moving towards the window the depressed man was scared, but for the first time in months he was gripped by another emotion - hope. He looks out the window down 110 stories to the busy streets below. The people down below looked like ants trapped in a maze. The man hesitated and looked back. With one last nod from the gentleman, he let go of the window sill.

After several moments, the hard packing sound mixed with shattered glass and the screams of women rang out through the air.

She laughs at his jokes, offers the slightest bit of flattery, and shares more than a few glasses of champagne. As the night eventually wraps up, he invites her back to his mansion.

One limousine ride and a nightcap later, he invites her to spend the night. She gleefully accepts, and he leads her to the bedroom.

As she enters the bedroom, she’s amazed at the opulent decor: four poster bed, full length mirro, tasteful if obviously expensive art and tapestries adorning the walls. This too, one day soon, would be hers.

The old man invites her to undress. She briefly hesitates, but a quick look around reminds her of the prize at hand. She’s come this far. Surely she could go a little further. At best, he’ll paw and fumble at her for a little while before falling asleep. Eye on the prize. Stay the course.

The old man admires her naked form for a short while, then excuses himself. Going to the bathroom to get ready, he says. 

She smiles, almost feeling sorry for him as he shuffles off. 

Minutes pass. The old man doesn’t return.

As she’s about to call out for him, the bathroom door opens.

At first she can’t quite process what she’s seeing: the old man is utterly naked, wearing a condom stretched over an unbelievable erection, earmuffs, and nose plugs.

“*Wha... what’s with the getup?*” She says, confused.

“*My dear,*” the old man says, “*there are two things I cannot stand in this life: the sounds of a woman screaming, and the smell of burning rubber*”",Jokes
where is that old lady?,"A man walks into a bar, notices a very large jar on the counter, and sees that it's filled to the brim with $10 bills. He guesses there must be at least ten thousand dollars in it.  
He approaches the bartender and asks, ""What's with the money in the jar?""  
""Well..., you pay $10, and if you pass three tests, you get all the money in the jar and the keys to a brand new Ferrari.""  
The man certainly isn't going to pass this up, so he asks, ""What are the three tests?""  
""You gotta pay first,"" says the bartender, ""those are the rules.""  
So, after thinking it over a while, the man gives the bartender $10 which he stuffs into the jar.  
""Okay,"" says the bartender, ""here's what you need to do: First - You have to drink a whole quart of tequila, in 60 seconds or less, and you can't make a face while doing it.""  
""Second - There's a pit bull chained in the back with a bad tooth. You have to remove that tooth with your bare hands.""  
""Third - There's a 90-year old lady upstairs who's never had sex. You have to take care of that problem."" The man is stunned! ""I know I paid my $10 - but I'm not an idiot! I won't do it! You'd have to be nuts to drink a quart of tequila and then do all those other things!""  
""Your call,"" says the bartender, ""but, your money stays where it is..""  
As time goes on, the man has a few more drinks and finally says, ""Where's the damn tequila?!"" He grabs the bottle with both hands and drinks it as fast as he can.. Tears stream down both cheeks -- but he doesn't make a face -- and he drinks it in 58 seconds!  
Next, he staggers out the back door where he sees the pit bull chained to a pole. Soon, the people inside the bar hear loud growling, screaming, and sounds of a terrible fight -- then nothing but silence!  
Just when they think that the man surely must be dead, he staggers back into the bar. His clothes are ripped to shreds and he's bleeding from bites and gashes all over his body.  
He drunkenly says, ""Now..., where's that old woman with the bad tooth?",Jokes

Going to church in Chicago,"When I heard Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson were guest preachers at a nearby church, I decided to go there and check them out in person.

As soon as I sat down, Reverend Sharpton came over to me. I don't know why, maybe it was because I was the only white person in the church?

He laid his hands on my shoulder and said: ""By the will of Jesus the Lord Almighty, and the will of God, you will walk today.” I told him I was not paralyzed.

Then Jesse Jackson came by and said: ""By the Grace of God, and his Son Jesus, the Lord Almighty, you will walk today.”

The gold digger,"So it happened during the 1890 Yukon gold rush that a young, smoking hot lady named Karma decided to trek north in pursuit of a gold miner because a clueless socialite friend of hers had remarked that the miners up there “literally crap gold”. A bit hazy on the details of where gold actually originate, she made the trip. 

Few weeks later she had moved in with a huge, barely literate miner and promptly set about sorting through his muck every evening while he was out drinking with his mates. One day though, she was caught in the act as the befuddled miner came home a bit early.

“Whadaya doin?” He spluttered, looking pretty shocked. 

“Oh… I just missed you so much”, she said, hoping the old fart would let it pass and remember nothing the next day.  

“Right then”, said the miner, oddly turned on by the this nasty display of affection. “Well if you love me so much, maybe I should put a wee nugget in your belly.”

“A nugget?”

The miner gave her a quirky smile, showing off his golden tooth and winked his eye brows.

“Aye, a nugget.”

“Oh, so THAT’s how that works. Yes, please put a nugget in me. I want it so bad”, Karma begged. 

Nine months later, the disappointment was complete as a small, pig like creature spilled out of her looking rather nothing like the piece of solid gold she had been expecting. 

Noting the look of dismay on Karmas face, the miner looked at the child and said:

“Well, not all of them are proper you see, we best try again. And so they did. And again. And again. Each time with the same result. 

The years went by and the woman was getting increasingly restless. This was not the life she had pictured for herself. One day, her bum of a man approached her, face blushing. 

“So I’ve been meaning to ask you something. Remember all those years ago when I found you fondling my shyte. Well, I was hoping that maybe you wouldn’t mind me giving you a golden shower. That would be magical.”

“A golden shower?”

“Aye. Again the quirky smile, the gold tooth sparkling and the eyebrows winking.”

“Oh, darling. I thought you would never ask. Yes, please shower me in gold. It’s all I ever wanted.”

“Ok but you have to drink every drop or the magic doesn’t happen.”

So she got down on her knees and let the miner finish his business. She drank every drop. The miners rod was stiff as a bone and the magic was just about to happen when the excitement got to him and he had a heart attack, dropping dead on the very spot.

As she looked at the face of the dead miner it dawned on her. The tooth. All she had to do was lose her teeth and gold would grow out. As luck would have it, a circus was in town and there she observed that the female mud wrestlers kept slapping each other in the face. Spotting her chance to get the teeth knocked out, she managed to replace one of the battered women, who stayed behind in the gold miners house, raising his piglets. 

A couple of years later, she had lost all her teeth but one. So far, not a single gold tooth had emerged. What was worse, the circus manager treated her very poorly and paid her just a few pennies a week. 

“What did you expect, a pot of gold?” said the manager as she dared to raise the issue. 

“Womething like wat”, she mumbled as the last tooth fell out and landed pathetically in front of her. 

“Well I won’t have it”, said the manager and kicked her from the still moving circus wagon. She rolled down the side of a mountain and ended up by the side of a small river. There she saw a man in the water, fishing. 

“Heya”, shouted the man. “It’s Dave. You know why I’m here don’t you?”

“No”, she said, utterly fed up with just about everything (even though she of course knew very well who Dave was). 

“Be a doll and pick up that spear and help me fish. Looking for gold aint ya?”

“How wiw you wow?”

“Well I hate to break it to you honey, but you’re in a joke you see. And whoever is writing it is kinda using your sorry non-existence to dig for…”

“Gowd? You mean weaw, actuaw gowd?”

“Sure. Gold. Why not?”

“Pweathe don’t woy with me, I’ve wug thwough shit, biwthed fouw bastawd childwen, dwank pith and had all my teeph knocked out, I can’t thtand any mowe false hophe.”

“Well, that’s the problem you see. Have you noticed that this joke kind of seems to grind on and on and on… with no real end in sight? Well that is because the author started writing it with no punchline in mind, but determined to create original content no matter what.”

Dave sighs loudly and looks at the woman with a strange look in his eyes, then continues:

“I mean, there is one thing you could do I suppose. But I have to warn you, it is vile. Just answer me… what did the reddit user say after detonating a bomb inside a bank?”

“Wha da fux a weddit?”

“Just say it… Defile yourself.”

“Pith of, I wont wo it.”

“Wa wa woo wo. You know you will… you know you want to. It’s such a good line too, whoever though of it must have had a laughgasm, a guilded hissyfit. Go on… fornicate yourself in repostage. You’ll get your gold. All you have to do is…”

“FINE! Wow, wis shuw bwew up, fankth for the gowd.”

Dave laughed a mad mans’ evil laughter which echoed across the valley. “Oh you gullible little thing. Don’t you know reposts can never get gold? I am Dave. I should know.”

Suddenly he felt a sharp pain in the abdomen and as he looked down, realised that she had put his own spear straight through him. She grinned a toothless grin and weasily exhaled in sweet retaliation:

"A German, a Dutchman and a Belgian guy are stranded on a tropical island","On their way to find food and drinkwater they are captured by a local tribe of cannibals. Scared for their lives, they beg for a deal or a bribe that can get them out of this nasty situation.

Luckily for them, these cannibals have a suitable, albeit strage, custom. They offer the stranded sailors a deal: You each have to bring us 3 pieces of a fruit of your choosing.

Happily suprised with the easiness of this deal, the 3 guys spur off into the jungle. 

The German returns first, carrying 3 grapes, shortly followed by the Dutchman who is carrying 3 blueberries. The Belgian man is nowhere to be found however. After waiting for over 15 minutes, the cannibals start to lose patience and decide to continue with the challenge without the Belgian guy.

""Now, put all 3 fruits up your ass without laughing"" they say.

The German and Dutchman look at each other surprised, but sure enough, if it saves them from being cooked alive and eaten..

The German guy goes first. Humorless and efficient as Germans are, all 3 grapes go in smoothly and without laughter.

The Dutchman is next. But after putting 2 blueberries up his ass, he suddenly bursts into laughter.

"Dave, an alcoholic abusive father, comes home one day, after drinking at the bar all morning, to find his family, some close friends, and a therapist, all there for an intervention.","Dave, nearly blackout drunk, stumbles past everyone as he makes his way into the kitchen where he grabs a beer.

Timmy, Dave's son, looks up at his dad with one eye swollen shut, and says: ""Please daddy, you need to stop... We love you""

An old hunter goes to the doctor (remastered),"An old hunter goes to his doctor. The doctor asked what brought him here today. The man told him that he and his twenty year old wife were trying to have a baby. The doctor told the hunter that most men that age would most likely be infertile. But the man was arrogant and told him that he was wrong.  The doctor said alright and that he was going to do a couple of tests, and that he would have the results in two weeks. 


The man left and came back two weeks later with a smug face. But before the doctor could tell him the results. The man said that the results wont matter. The man explained that after their appointment he had sex with his wife, and that his wife was already pregnant. The doctor was dumbfounded, but than understood what had happened. The doctor was too embarrassed to tell the hunter what happened so he asked if he could tell him a story. 


The man didn't mind so the doctor told the story of an frail old hunter that lived in the woods. One day the hunter wanted to hunt as usual, but instead of grabbing his rifle he accidentally grabbed his walking stick. Later on his hunting trip he spotted a beaver up on a hill. The hunter took aim with his walking stick, and just as he was about to shoot he shouted BOOM! A moment of silence than followed, and shortly after the beaver fell dead.

The doctor asked how this is possible, and the man didn't know. The man said that the only explanation would be that another hunter must have shot the beaver. The doctor said exactly, someone else must have blew their load in the beaver.",Jokes

"A butcher is at work, chopping up some meat when he hears the door open.","He walks to the door and sees a golden retriever with a note in its mouth. The butcher, amused, grabs the note and reads it. The note says, ""I'll take a dozen sausage links. Keep the change."" The butcher scoffs and is about to throw the note away until he takes another look at the dog, who is now holding a $20 bill in his mouth. Slightly puzzled, the butcher obliges the dog's order, wrapping up the sausages in ice and putting them into a basket. He sets the basket in front of the dog, who picks it up with his mouth and walks out.

The butcher, now curious, temporarily closes up shop and decides to follow the dog. He trails the dog a couple of blocks until the dog stops at a bus stop. As a bus pulls up, the dog turns his head to look at the bus's number and stays seated. The butcher is stunned that the dog knows how buses work, much less which bus is his. Eventually, the bus arrives, and the butcher follows the dog onto the bus.

After about 20 minutes, the bus arrives at a stop in the suburbs, where the dog decides to get off, and so the butcher follows suit. The dog walks another couple of blocks until it arrives at a large, 3 story house, with a nice garden, and even a fountain in the center. The dog walks up to the front door of the house and pauses for a moment. It sets the sausage links to the side, takes a few steps back, and rams itself into the door at top speed, producing a loud ""thud."" The dog, a bit dazed, gets up and steps back again, as the butcher stares in confusion. The dog strikes the door again, producing another crashing sound. Suddenly, the door opens, and the man inside starts yelling furiously at the dog.

The butcher intervenes, saying, ""Hey! Do you even know how smart this dog is?! It can write, read, use money, and take the bus! Hell, I'm sure there are even some \*people\* that can't do that! Who do you think you are?""

The man looks up at the butcher, still angry, and says, ""Nonono, you don't understand. This is the third time he forgot his keys!""",Jokes
